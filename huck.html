Nevertheless, ever since the mid-twentieth century these two works have customarily been separated by publishers, libraries, and bookstores, with Tom Sawyer relegated to &ldquo;Juvenile&rdquo; or &ldquo;Young Adult&rdquo; catalogs and Huckleberry Finn elevated to &ldquo;Adult&rdquo; lists, as though they have almost no relationship to each other. Literature teachers, too, understandably tend to impose a division between Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;with its limited village environs, and Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;which features an eventful journey by raft in search of freedom. Severance of the two books has proceeded in spite of evidence that Twain wrote the opening chapters of Huckleberry Finn soon after completing the manuscript for Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and the fact that Huckleberry Finn announces in the sequel&rsquo;s very first sentence, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know about me, without you have read a book by the name of &lsquo;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.&rsquo;&rdquo; Moreover, characters and settings are shared by both novels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">Twain even attempted to ensure that sample copies of Tom Sawyer were carried by his &ldquo;canvassers&rdquo; who fanned out through neighborhoods and farmlands to take book orders for Twain&rsquo;s forthcoming Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(For nearly thirty years Mark Twain&rsquo;s works were sold only through these &ldquo;subscription&rdquo; agents and could not be obtained in retail bookstores, a lucrative but somewhat disreputable practice for an author of his stature.) Twain recommended to his publisher that customers purchasing both Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn be given a reduced price on the set. However, since Twain had left the press that brought out Tom Sawyer in 1876</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and was rebelliously publishing Huckleberry Finn under the imprint of his own company</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">tangled negotiations with his previous firm prevented this joint sale of the volumes from materializing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">Owing to difficulties in resolving plot developments and to other interruptions, the sequel to Tom Sawyer was delayed for eight long years. The hitches in Twain&rsquo;s composition of Huckleberry Finn are comprehensible when his basic plot dilemma is grasped: somehow the author had to move a fleeing boy and a runaway slave farther and farther south on the Mississippi River below St. Louis &mdash; in other words, down to the part of the river with which Mark Twain had become familiar as a steamboat pilot. Yet logically the slave (and therefore his helper Huckleberry Finn) should want to head north toward the &ldquo;free&rdquo; states where human slavery had already been abolished by the 1840s, the decade in which Twain&rsquo;s novel takes place. Twain solved part of this predicament by having Huck and Jim become lost in a dense fog at night and drift past the Ohio River inlet that led north.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c4">The second inspiration t</span><span class="c1">ook longer to occur to Twain, but eventually he came up with the idea of having the raft on which Huck and Jim had lived so contentedly be commandeered by two rapscallions who, in a mockery of European titles, grandly style themselves the &ldquo;King&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Duke.&rdquo; That solution put Twain over the largest hurdle and he then managed to wrap up the novel by reintroducing Tom Sawyer, thus returning to the &ldquo;boy book&rdquo; playacting which had characterized Tom Sawyer and carried over into the early chapters of Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;These serial stages of development meant that the volume did not issue in the United States until 1885. By that time even his most loyal readers had trouble thinking of the books as forming a seamless story, with the result that customers usually elected to order Huckleberry Finn in a green cover rather than the available blue cloth that would have matched the cover of the earlier Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Today most people think of them as entirely separate works.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.b1ix5komjx0t"><span class="c16">THE NEWSOUTH EDITION OF </span><span class="c16 c37">ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">Whether considered together or apart, </span><span class="c7 c4">Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c7 c4">Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;do have one thing in </span><span class="c4">common</span><span class="c1">: racial slurs in their contents have increasingly presented a problem for teachers, students, and general readers. The editor&rsquo;s decision to eliminate these epithets in Huckleberry Finn is likely to remain controversial. Quite simply, he hopes to introduce this book to a wider readership than it can currently enjoy. Twain, it should be remembered, was endeavoring to accurately depict the prevailing social attitudes along the Mississippi River Valley during the 1840s by repeatedly employing a linguistic corruption of &ldquo;Negro&rdquo; in reference to African American slaves. In Huckleberry Finn barely educated boys and uneducated adult characters in Missouri and Arkansas casually toss about this racial insult a total of 214 times (with the novel&rsquo;s table of contents adding another one).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">The n-word possessed, then as now, demeaning implications more vile than any insult that can be applied to other racial groups. There is no equivalent slur in the English language. As a result, with every passing decade this affront appears to gain rather than lose its impact. Even at the level of college and graduate school, students are capable of resenting textual encounters with this pejorative racial appellative. In the 1870s and 1880s, of course, Twain scarcely had to concern himself about the feelings of African American readers. That population group was too occupied with trying to recover from the degradation of slavery and the institution of Jim Crow segregation policies to bother about an objectionable vocabulary choice in a popular book.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c4">When Samuel L. Clemens (who would adopt the pen name &ldquo;Mark Twain&rdquo; in 1863) was growing up in Hannibal, Missouri, his views on slavery were in keeping with those of his fellow villagers. His father, significantly, had owned as many slaves as he could afford. In a letter written when he was seventeen, Sam Clemens mockingly alluded to Northern people attem</span><span class="c1">pting to free slaves as &ldquo;infernal abolitionists&rdquo; (August 23, 1853). But as an adult, after he had traveled widely and read more, he courted and married (in 1870) a woman whose New York State family had vehemently opposed slavery long before the Civil War. Twain ultimately made an unreserved turnabout from his younger attitudes, so much so that in 1874 he wrote a profoundly touching account of how the slave system had cruelly split up African American families</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;A True Story, Repeated Word for Word as I Heard It.&rdquo; A similar impulse led Twain to portray Huckleberry Finn as (in Twain&rsquo;s summation in one of his notebooks) a boy with &ldquo;a sound heart and a deformed conscience&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that is to say, someone reared amid such pervasive prejudice that he had a hard time seeing through its premises. This conception has become a heavier and heavier burden for the book to carry ever since the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s erased many racial impediments and sensitized succeeding generations of Americans to the manner in which language can affect thinking.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">We might recognize Twain&rsquo;s incentive as a prominent American literary realist to record the speech of a particular region during a specific historical era, but abusive racial insults nonetheless repulse modern-day readers. Twain&rsquo;s two books do not deserve ever to join that list of literary &ldquo;classics&rdquo; he once humorously defined as books &ldquo;which people praise and don&rsquo;t read,&rdquo; yet their long-lofty status has come under question in recent decades. In this connection, it seems relevant to remember that Twain habitually read aloud his day&rsquo;s writings to an audience gathered on the porch of his summer retreat overlooking Elmira, New York, watching and listening for reactions to each manuscript page. He likewise took cues about adjusting his tone from lecture platform appearances, which provided him with direct responses to his diction. As a notoriously commercial writer who watched for every opportunity to enlarge the mass market for his works, he would presumably have been quick to adapt his diction if he could have prophesied how today&rsquo;s audiences recoil at racial slurs in a culturally altered country.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.x40xrf3s8ps1"><span class="c16">THE EDITOR&rsquo;S STORY</span></h1><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">Through a succession of first-hand experiences, this editor gradually reached the conclusion that an optional epithet-free edition of Twain&rsquo;s books is needed today. For nearly forty years I have led college classes, bookstore forums, and library reading groups in detailed discussions of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn in California, Texas, New York, and Alabama, and I always found myself unable to utter the racist put-downs spoken by numerous characters, including Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. I invariably substituted the word &ldquo;slave&rdquo; for Twain&rsquo;s ubiquitous n-word whenever I read any passages aloud. Students and audience members seemed to find this expedient to be preferable, and I could detect a visible sense of relief each time, as though a nagging problem with the text had been addressed. Indeed, numerous communities have dropped Huckleberry Finn as required reading in public schools owing to its offensive racial language and have quietly moved the title to voluntary reading lists. The American Library Association lists this novel among the most frequently challenged pre-twentieth-century books across the nation.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">Over the years I have taken note of valiant and judicious defenses of the prevalence of the n-word in Twain&rsquo;s Huckleberry Finn as proposed by eminent writers, editors, and scholars, including those of Michael Patrick Hearn, Nat Hentoff, Randall Kennedy, and Jocelyn Chadwick-Joshua. Hearn, for example, correctly notes that &ldquo;Huck says it out of habit, not malice&rdquo; (22). Apologists quite validly encourage readers to intuit the irony behind Huck&rsquo;s ignorance and focus on Twain&rsquo;s larger satiric goals. Nonetheless, Langston Hughes made a forceful, lasting argument for omitting this incendiary word from all literature, however well-intentioned an author. &ldquo;Ironically or seriously, of necessity for the sake of realism, or impishly for the sake of comedy, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; explained Hughes. African Americans, Hughes wrote, &ldquo;do not like it in any book or play whatsoever, be the book or play ever so sympathetic.</span><span class="c4">...</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;They still do not like it&rdquo; (268-269).</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">During the 1980s, educator John H. Wallace unleashed a fierce and protracted dispute by denouncing Huckleberry Finn as &ldquo;the most grotesque example of racist trash ever written.&rdquo; In 1984 I had to walk past a picket line of African American parents outside a scholarly conference in Pennsylvania that was commemorating, among other achievements in American humor, the upcoming centenary anniversary of Twain&rsquo;s </span><span class="c7 c4">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;James S. Leonard, then the editor of the newsletter for the Mark Twain Circle of America, conceded in 2001 that the racist language and unflattering stereotypes of slaves in Huckleberry Finn can constitute &ldquo;real problems&rdquo; in certain classroom settings. Another scholar, Jonathan Arac, has urged that students be prompted to read other, more unequivocally abolitionist works rather than this one novel that has been consecrated as the mandatory literary statement about American slavery. The once-incontestable belief that the reading of this book at multiple levels of schooling ought to be essential for every American citizen&rsquo;s education is cracking around the edges.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">My personal turning-point on the journey toward this present NewSouth Edition was a lecture tour I undertook after writing the introduction for a National Endowment for the Arts-funded &ldquo;Big Read&rdquo; edition of </span><span class="c7 c4">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;designed to interest younger readers in older American literature. As I spoke about the novel to reading groups of adults and teenagers in small towns and in larger cities, I followed my customary habit of substituting the word &ldquo;slave&rdquo; when reading the characters&rsquo; dialogue aloud. In several towns I was taken aside after my talk by earnest middle and high school teachers who lamented the fact that they no longer felt justified in assigning either of Twain&rsquo;s boy books</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;because of the hurtful n-word. Here was further proof that this single debasing label is overwhelming every other consideration about Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;whereas what this novel has to offer readers hardly depends upon that one indefensible designation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c9 c4">Word exchanges</span><span class="c4">: </span><span class="c1">My understanding about this situation crystallized into a definite resolve. Unquestionably </span><span class="c7 c4">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;can be enjoyed just as deeply and authentically if readers are not obliged to confront the n-word on so many pages. Consequently in this edition I have elected to translate each usage of the n-word to read &ldquo;slave&rdquo; instead, since the term &ldquo;slave&rdquo; is closest in meaning and implication. Although the text loses some of the derisive spin that the n-word carries, that price seems small compared to the revolting effect that the more offensive word has on readers these days. Moreover, slavery is recognized globally as an affront to humanity.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">I had come to believe that a significant number of school teachers, college instructors, and general readers might welcome the option of an alternate edition of Twain&rsquo;s novel that spares the reader all contact with a racial slur that never seems to lose its vitriol. Despite occasional efforts of rap and hip hop musicians to appropriate it and well-meaning but usually futile (from my own experience) endeavors by classroom teachers to inoculate their students against it by using Huckleberry Finn as a springboard to discuss its etymology and cultural history, the n-word remains inarguably the most inflammatory word in the English language. The synonym &ldquo;slave&rdquo; seems to express adequately the cultural racism that Twain sought to convey, as in Huck Finn&rsquo;s report to Aunt Sally Phelps in Chapter 32 that a steamboat explosion had &ldquo;killed a slave,&rdquo; to which she responds heartlessly, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">This word</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;slave&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">also usefully reminds readers of the historical fact that ten percent of the Missouri population in 1850 consisted of African American slaves. In the contiguous state of Arkansas (where the latter part of Huckleberry Finn is set) the percentage was twenty-six, and that percentage rose drastically in the Deep South, with fifty-five percent of the residents of Mississippi consisting of enslaved workers. By 1860, four million of the twelve million people living in the Southern states were slaves who owned neither their bodies nor their labor.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">Similarly, the editor has rendered a racially derogatory label for Native Americans as &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; in order to assist in retiring another antiquated and insulting word (even though the very name &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; itself commemorates a misnomer, perpetuated by erring explorers and cartographers eager for a new trade route to India). Presumably a merely informative racial sobriquet will inflict less injury on the descendants of a native people who were endeavoring to survive the ravages of diseases and the onslaught of settlers and buffalo-hunters that had decimated their ways of life during the era in which this novel was published.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.punjy84qjd0f"><span class="c16">REEVALUATING THE &ldquo;BOY BOOK&rdquo;</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">At the time that </span><span class="c7 c4">Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and its sequel, </span><span class="c7 c4">Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;first appeared, the line between juvenile and adult fiction was far from definite. Adults and young people often shared their reading materials. The spectacular success of the </span><span class="c7 c4">Harry Potter</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;series with broad audiences reminds us of that formerly blurry distinction between juvenile and adult literature. For over a decade, bookstores and movie theaters teemed with crowds of children, teenagers, and parents each night that a new </span><span class="c7 c4">Harry Potter</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;installment was released. Similarly, more than a century and a quarter earlier, Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alice&rdquo; stories in 1865 and 1872 were hardly restricted to young readers.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">All the same, Twain&rsquo;s </span><span class="c7 c4">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;extended the boundaries of a subgenre combining fiction and autobiography that would come to be known as the American &ldquo;boy book.&rdquo; The very idea that a boy&rsquo;s thought-processes and actions were worthy of recording in a novel was itself still an innovation in the nineteenth century, despite Charles Dickens&rsquo;s steps in this direction. Thomas Hughes (1822-1896), an English writer and reformer, is credited with launching the investigations of boyish minds with </span><span class="c7 c4">Tom Brown&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c4">School Days</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(1857), largely based on Hughes&rsquo;s remembrances of loyalties and cruelties at Rugby School. It seems probable that Twain&rsquo;s memories of early day Hannibal were jogged by the now-forgotten Thomas Bailey Aldrich&rsquo;s semi-autobiographical </span><span class="c7 c4">The Story of a Bad Boy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(1869), the first true &ldquo;boy book&rdquo; in the United States, whose sentimental incidents were told somewhat archly. Aldrich&rsquo;s Tom Bailey and his chums slip out of their homes at night, coalesce into a small gang, and play pranks on the upright citizens of their New England town. Twain scoffed at Aldrich&rsquo;s </span><span class="c7 c4">Bad Boy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on December 27, 1869, writing to the woman he would soon marry, Olivia Langdon, &ldquo;I could not admire the volume much.&rdquo; Nevertheless in 1872 he began to experiment with the possibility of composing a work about his own Missouri boyhood. He aborted that effort, of which only a fragment known as &ldquo;Boy&rsquo;s Manuscript&rdquo; survives, but in 1874 he got the novel underway that would rival and long outlast Thomas Bailey Aldrich&rsquo;s creation, </span><span class="c4 c7">The</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c4">Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(which had a protagonist named &ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; just like Aldrich&rsquo;s book). Other male writers such as William Dean Howells, Charles Dudley Warner, and Booth Tarkington would follow in Twain&rsquo;s wake by recounting the fun and the terrors of boyhood, but only Harold Frederic&rsquo;s evocative tales and Stephen Crane&rsquo;s poignant </span><span class="c7 c4">Whilomville Stories</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(1900) deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Twain&rsquo;s works.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c7 c4">Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;departed from literary conventions by jabbing at clich&eacute;d children&rsquo;s books, notifying readers that the age of Realism had arrived in America. Twain had fun at the expense of Romantic icons by having Tom Sawyer ludicrously misconstrue nearly all of his revered literary &ldquo;authorities.&rdquo; Twain developed this humorous tactic more fully in </span><span class="c7 c4">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;where Tom misguidedly quotes his outmoded Romantic books relentlessly and, in Chapter 13, a sinking steamboat is named Walter Scott after the deceased but still esteemed author of </span><span class="c7 c4">Ivanhoe</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c4">Redgauntlet</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c4">Kenilworth</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and other historical novels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.cer8qv8xy8mj"><span class="c16">CRITICS&rsquo; OBJECTIONS TO HUCKLEBERRY FINN</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">Twain&rsquo;s </span><span class="c7 c4">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was more ambitious in plot than its predecessor and brilliantly allowed a single boy to narrate his own tale. All the same, the vast majority of commentators tend to express dissatisfaction with the manner in which Twain opened and concluded his masterpiece. This disappointment is even voiced by many of the novel&rsquo;s most ardent admirers. The failing, for the preponderance of scholarly critics, is that Twain insisted on reinserting Tom Sawyer into the first three and last eleven chapters of the forty-three-chapter novel, thereby giving the book a subtle structural symmetry and avoiding a tragic climax. Academic critics also have two additional cavils. While they applaud the interracial friendship that develops in Huckleberry Finn between the African American adult and the parentless white boy, they are bothered by Jim&rsquo;s ungrammatical dialect and concerned about Huck&rsquo;s periodic sense of superiority to him. Above all, however, they deplore Tom Sawyer&rsquo;s tomfoolery in the concluding &ldquo;evasion&rdquo; (Tom&rsquo;s term for it) sequence of Chapters 33 to 40 when he subjects Jim to absurd and time-consuming requirements rather than liberating the imprisoned man. These three objections</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Twain&rsquo;s handling of the &ldquo;evasion&rdquo; chapters, Jim&rsquo;s speech patterns, and Jim&rsquo;s relationship to Huck and Tom</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">merit thoughtful consideration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.hh6i02a8j2vb"><span class="c16">THE PITFALLS OF LITERARY BURLESQUE</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">More than anything else, readers&rsquo; pronounced distaste for the so-called &ldquo;evasion&rdquo; episode at the end of Huckleberry Finn amounts to a rejection of Twain&rsquo;s penchant for literary burlesque</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">a technique of ridicule by absurd exaggeration that he had mastered early in his writing career and repeatedly returned to in his sketches, short stories, and longer works. In 1859 Clemens had burlesqued the river reports of Isaiah Sellers, a veteran pilot, and the literary hoaxes of his Western years, such as &ldquo;Petrified Man&rdquo; (1862) and &ldquo;A Bloody Massacre Near Carson&rdquo; (1863) relied, in the former case, on the frequency of fossil finds and (in the latter instance) took advantage of the bloodthirsty credulity of frontier journalism. In the mature phases of his career, he often turned this literary form against authors he basically admired; literary burlesque supported, for example, his ingenious spoof of Sir Thomas Malory&rsquo;s Morte d&rsquo;Arthur and Alfred Lord Tennyson&rsquo;s Idylls of the King in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&rsquo;s Court (1889). The Duke and the King&rsquo;s mishmash of Shakespearean plays in Chapters 20 and 21 of Huckleberry Finn likewise comes across as hilarious inasmuch as those garbled but immortal lines from the Bard remain familiar to us; the jumbled treatment of them is brief and delectable. But when Twain took aim elsewhere (in other works) at books for which he had less respect</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">as, for example, his burlesques of detective Allan Pinkerton&rsquo;s boasting memoirs about his exploits or Twain&rsquo;s mockeries of Arthur Conan Doyle&rsquo;s infallibly ratiocinative Sherlock Holmes</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the results often failed to endure as successful literature.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">The chapters that wind up Huckleberry Finn&rsquo;s journey fall somewhere between these examples in terms of their effectiveness. Although the prompt arrival of Tom Sawyer at the exact farm where Huck and Jim have landed asks us to accept a monumental coincidence, this happenstance is really not much more incredible than Abel Magwitch&rsquo;s secret funding of Pip&rsquo;s rise in social status in Dickens&rsquo;s Great Expectations during the period when Miss Havisham appears to be favoring him. Timely rescues and discoveries of family connections were taken for granted in Oliver Twist and David Copperfield</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;since plot-line coincidences were a well-established literary convention of the nineteenth century. Roger Chillingworth arrives in the Puritan colony just in time to witness Hester&rsquo;s humiliating climb upon the scaffold in Hawthorne&rsquo;s The Scarlet Letter</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Lambert Strether glimpses two people at a revealingly intimate moment in James&rsquo;s The Ambassadors</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and the saloon safe fails to lock in Dreiser&rsquo;s Sister Carrie on the day that George Hurstwood is contemplating a fantasy of leaving Chicago. To recall anticipatory examples, one need only contemplate the number of fortuitous or calamitous coincidences in the works of Richardson, Defoe, Smollett, and other trend-setting practitioners of the novel.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">A far more profound difficulty for the twenty-first-century reader is the fact that Twain gambled (and lost) on a bet that future generations would be familiar with, and enthralled by, a literary fad of his day that evaporated during the twentieth century. To furnish literary models for Tom Sawyer&rsquo;s notions about proper prison escapes, Twain set out to burlesque a combined number of &ldquo;dungeon&rdquo; books that had chronicled the isolation, suffering, and escapes of prisoners who languished in damp and dreary cells in England and Europe. William Ainsworth&rsquo;s The Tower of London (1840) was among the novels treating confinement and the prospect of imminent death. Thomas Carlyle&rsquo;s The French Revolution (1837) recorded lurid details about the Bastille. Alexandre Dumas&rsquo;s The Man in the Iron Mask (1839) and The Count of Monte Cristo (1845) added elements of irony and revenge to tales of forced incarceration. Baron Friedrich von der Trenck&rsquo;s Life was translated from German between 1788 and 1793 with American editions that followed; Trenck&rsquo;s memoirs supplied Twain with ideas about taming a mouse, using a penknife to dig, making a rope from bed sheets, sawing a bed-leg, and encountering a moat. Twain is on record as being fascinated by the memoirs of Casanova, a copy of which he acquired in 1879 and which provided details about imprisonment and escapes. Likewise Twain referred to Benvenuto Cellini&rsquo;s Life (1728), a chronicle of banishment and frequent flight amid the beauties of the Renaissance, as &ldquo;that most entertaining of books.&rdquo; Joseph X. B. Saintine&rsquo;s Picciola</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a novel published in 1836, told the sad story of a man condemned to solitary imprisonment whose sanity and health are flickeringly kept alive by a plant seed that drifts in through the window of his cell and grows into a blossoming flower; he carefully tends and waters this single point of focus in his otherwise </span><span class="c4">claustrophobic</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;cell.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">Although today&rsquo;s readers may possibly have seen films based on Dumas&rsquo;s exciting novels, our age is otherwise ignorant of this once-popular craze for stories of the horrors of captivity and the fortitude and cunning of dungeon prisoners. The appetite for these tales died out soon after the success of Anthony Hope&rsquo;s The Prisoner of Zenda (1894). Consequently the humor of Twain&rsquo;s lampoons of his bygone sources seems pointlessly exaggerated and drawn out. My personal experiments with distributing samples of these dungeon narratives to my college students indicate that those textual aids can resurrect the comedy and enable students to find the conclusion of Huckleberry Finn more comprehensible and enjoyable, but this exploration can only take place in a classroom setting. Ordinary readers cannot be expected to trace the background of Twain&rsquo;s attempt at burlesquing formerly popular stories.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">What, then, are readers disappointed by Tom&rsquo;s reappearance and his insistence on resuming his jejune games of pretending (in this instance based on his romanticized notions of dungeon literature) to do about the ending of a work they otherwise cherish? Perhaps it would help to consider Mark Twain&rsquo;s situation as he came to this juncture of his novel. He had started out to write another &ldquo;boy book,&rdquo; a sequel to his relatively well-received novel </span><span class="c7 c4">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;but then he had the fortuitous inspiration to let this outcast boy narrate his own story. Having rehearsed the same juvenile antics that characterized Tom Sawyer in the first three chapters of this new book, Twain abruptly introduces the sinister figure of Huck Finn&rsquo;s father in Chapter 4 and the novel takes a far more serious turn. In Chapter 8, Huck, hiding out on Jackson&rsquo;s Island, encounters Jim, Miss Watson&rsquo;s runaway slave. For the next twenty-four chapters, critics agree that it is as if, ensconced in his airy little octagonal study atop the hill at Quarry Farm and looking down on the shining Chemung River snaking its way past the town of Elmira below, Twain held a muse-driven pen transmitting divine bolts of lightning from the heavens; he wrote, in several separated stretches, a story immensely better than he had probably intended and far superior to any boy book that had preceded or would follow this masterpiece of fiction. But when the raft landed again and Jim was sold by the unscrupulous King, Twain, a master of short stories and newspaper and magazine sketches but an author invariably troubled by the intricacies of plotting a novel, had to confront the fact that he had moved Huck&rsquo;s tale deeper into a South where slaves were more numerous and that institution firmly entrenched. He still envisioned this as a companion piece to the earlier, lightsome </span><span class="c7 c4">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;despite the problems that had delayed its completion, and so he veered instinctively away from any possibility of a gloomy ending.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">Would the book have been more authentic and less criticized if Twain had shown an inclination to face up to the realities of slavery in the 1840s and to the unlikelihood that Jim could have returned to St. Petersburg as a free man who owned himself? John Seeley tested this hypothesis in 1970 by rewriting Twain&rsquo;s novel as </span><span class="c7 c4">The True Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c1">; in that version we are spared the Phelps farm episode and the book-addled reemergence of Tom Sawyer, because Jim has died a heroic death attempting to swim across the river in manacles. Although Seelye&rsquo;s tour de force was an enormous sensation when it issued, it hardly became the preferred version and was seldom invoked after a few years passed. Was Mark Twain not then correct, after all, in appending eleven fairly brief chapters at the end which in effect allowed his readers to decompress from the &ldquo;raft&rdquo; chapters that had gone before and returned the story to the level of the three &ldquo;boy book&rdquo; chapters of horseplay that had commenced the narrative? These closing chapters form a bookend matching not only the opening chapters but also the tone of the preceding novel. He avoided any horrific ending for Huckleberry Finn </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the Boggs shooting and the Shepherson-Grangerford massacre had given us an adequate taste of violence</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and got to relive and share with readers the sights, sounds, food, and general atmosphere of blissful summers at his uncle John Quarles&rsquo;s farm in interior Missouri. Tom Sawyer&rsquo;s exaggerated dictates may not be what most readers would prefer, but they are really no more outlandish (and much less harmful) than the nonsensical claims uttered by the King and the Duke aboard the raft and at the Wilks family&rsquo;s home, or the insane feuds of warring patriarchal clans that Huck witnessed, or the bitter glimpses of human nature to which Huck was exposed along the river. The novel comes to a soft, safe end of the voyage, like a raft bumping gently and finally against the land at its eventual destination. The lightning in Twain&rsquo;s pen had departed, but his memories of a Missouri farm and his determination to keep the narrative within the perimeters of a boy book took over and guided him into port.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.1uk5xbq3e5o1"><span class="c16">THE MAGNETISM OF FOLK SPEECH</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">Jim speaks with an untutored dialect because it was against the law in nearly all slave states (including Missouri) to allow slaves to attend school or otherwise learn to read and write. Penalties for conferring the gift of literacy on a slave were quite severe by the 1830s and usually consisted of substantial prison sentences as well as fines. Huck&rsquo;s own education has been so hit and miss that in numerous passages his English is not much more standard than Jim&rsquo;s. Yet both Jim and Huck are sufficiently communicative when they need to be, and their phrasing is often memorable. Huck reels off scattered bits of prose poetry (&ldquo;it most froze me,&rdquo; &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t got no show,&rdquo; &ldquo;lazying around,&rdquo; &ldquo;the song-birds just going it!,&rdquo; &ldquo;kind of clogged up the air&rdquo;) and effortlessly invents examples of onomatopoeia (the &ldquo;screaking&rdquo; of rafts&rsquo; sweeps, &ldquo;bull-frogs a-cluttering,&rdquo; axes going &ldquo;k&rsquo;chunk! &rdquo;). Twain appears to be saying that rules of grammar cannot harness the power and aesthetic of genuine folk speech. Jim hits the right note when it matters greatly, as in Chapter 16 at the moment that Huck is wrestling with his conscience and Jim calls out (just before Huck meets two slave-catchers): &ldquo;Jim won&rsquo;t ever forgit you, Huck; you&rsquo;s de bes&rsquo; fren&rsquo; Jim&rsquo;s ever had; en you&rsquo;s de only fren&rsquo; ole Jim&rsquo;s got, now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.skbajnl02ume"><span class="c16">JIM&rsquo;S ACQUIESCENCE TO HUCK AND TOM</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">As for the contention that Huck condescends to his fellow passenger on the raft, one can assume that Twain was determined to provide a plausible picture of his own provincial ignorance at Huck&rsquo;s age. Jim, on the other hand, knows that he is utterly dependent on Huck&rsquo;s goodwill to keep him from being caught. He may out of necessity give the appearance of docility, yet he is hardly a buffoon. In a novel abounding in secrets</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Huck himself pretends to be murdered, Tom Sawyer hides the news of Miss Watson&rsquo;s manumission of Jim, and various other characters withhold or distort information</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Jim keeps mum about a monumental discovery he made in Chapter 9 that probably would have dissuaded Huck from accompanying him any farther. At the time Jim shrewdly excused the deception to Huck as &ldquo;too gashly&rdquo; to reveal.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">Regarding Jim&rsquo;s overly obedient subjugation to Tom Sawyer&rsquo;s romantic whims, let it be remembered that in Chapter 40 when the injured Tom reaches the raft and commands Huck and Jim to cast off and &ldquo;man the sweeps</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">man the sweeps,&rdquo; it is Jim who boldly declares, &ldquo;I doan&rsquo; budge a step out&rsquo;n dis place, &rsquo;dout a doctor; not ef it&rsquo;s forty year!&rdquo; He thus voluntarily and selflessly casts himself back into slavery in order to save Tom&rsquo;s life. Huck agrees with Jim about the seriousness of Tom&rsquo;s wound, and they withstand Tom&rsquo;s protests: &ldquo;He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn&rsquo;t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn&rsquo;t let him. Then he gave us a piece of his mind</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but it didn&rsquo;t do no good.&rdquo; This incident goes far to rebut the many critics who denounce Huck and Jim&rsquo;s inability to resist Tom&rsquo;s grandstanding.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">As a prisoner on the Phelps farm, Jim is obliged to make peace with Tom&rsquo;s insistence that he inscribe his dungeon wall and plant a flower in the cabin and so forth (though he firmly draws the line at the suggestion that he adopt a rattlesnake as a pet). Huck, on the other hand, follows Tom&rsquo;s ever-expanding script because he relishes the entertainment, especially its flourishes and embellishments. Tom is the foil who brings invention, glory, and British and European literature into Huck Finn&rsquo;s deprived existence. It is Tom who creates elaborate schemes that pretend the world is a place of intrigue, suspense, and danger</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">without, of course, challenging except in play the social foundations of human slavery. Yet whereas Tom manufactures the dangers, it turns out to be Huck who has the nerve to overcome actual hazards along the river and try to do something about humanity&rsquo;s injustices. (Ironically, too, it is Huck and not the show-offy Tom who composes a lengthy picaresque novel.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.ddcjjwx7slwf"><span class="c16">HUCKLEBERRY FINN AS REALIST</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">Tom and Huck are one of the best-matched teams in literature, and even at the outset of critical commentary on the novel in the 1920s it was apparent to careful readers that Twain had in mind a younger version of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Don Quixote was one of Twain&rsquo;s favorite books because, Twain declared in Life on the Mississippi</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Cervantes&rsquo;s work &ldquo;swept the world&rsquo;s admiration for the mediaeval chivalry-silliness out of existence.&rdquo; A principal target of the Tom-and-Huck exchanges was the idealized fiction and poetry of English Romanticism that still in some respects overshadowed the American realistic movement of which Twain was a stalwart champion. Huck Finn&rsquo;s habit of noting gross particulars, even while absorbing a sublime sight, constitutes a vote against the earlier view that literature should primarily ennoble human perceptions. A single sentence in Huckleberry Finn aptly captures the gist of what Twain sought to accomplish in revolutionizing the outlook of fiction. Huck interrupts (in Chapter 19) his tribute to the beauty of dawn along the river&rsquo;s forested shoreline with a jarringly frank acknowledgment: &ldquo;The breeze</span><span class="c4">...</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell, on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way, because they&rsquo;ve left dead fish laying around, gars, and such, and they do get pretty rank.&rdquo; Few if any authors before Mark Twain (other than Walt Whitman) would have included in this context such an unsavory detail as the pungent odor of rotting fish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.lkjrd1n3e0m"><span class="c16">ERNEST HEMINGWAY AND HUCKLEBERRY FINN</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">In a semi fictional work, Green Hills of Africa (1935), Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s narrator made an astute and widely quoted pronouncement about Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The key element in this opinion was the word &ldquo;modern&rdquo;: &ldquo;All modern American literature,&rdquo; Hemingway&rsquo;s character declared, &ldquo;comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c4">....</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;All American writing comes from that. There was nothing before&rdquo; (italics added). Hemingway had noticed a momentous difference between Twain&rsquo;s novel and its literary precursors. In &ldquo;modern&rdquo; literature, as opposed to much British and American fiction of the nineteenth century, the reader is no longer coached regarding what to think of the characters and their actions. This prior type of moral guidance had typically been threaded obliquely throughout the paragraphs of a novel, or else summarized overtly at the end of a chapter or a short story.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">In contrast to this previous view of the author&rsquo;s role as both narrator and interpreter, Twain devised a narrator so young and inexperienced that he often cannot quite figure out what he is describing. That is the case, for instance, in Chapter 22 when Huck sneaks into a circus and relates how an intoxicated man staggers out of the audience and demands a chance to ride one of the performers&rsquo; horses. The crowd hoots and jeers at the drunk&rsquo;s interruption of the show, until the ring-master reluctantly gives in and allows the man to mount one of the animals. At first Huck is fearful for the man&rsquo;s safety as the trained horse races around the ring at faster and faster gaits, with the helpless man &ldquo;hanging onto his neck, and his heels flying up in the air.&rdquo; Then Huck (along with the crowd) is astonished when this &ldquo;sot&rdquo; suddenly stands up on the galloping steed, sheds layers of clothing &ldquo;so thick they kind of clogged up the air,&rdquo; and reveals himself to be &ldquo;slim and handsome&rdquo; in an acrobatic costume that was &ldquo;the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw.&rdquo; Immediately he &ldquo;lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">What is Huckleberry Finn&rsquo;s response to this obviously well-rehearsed circus act? Huck erroneously perceives it as a clever prank played by a stunt-rider on the ring-master. &ldquo;The ring-master he see how he had been fooled, and he was the sickest ring-master you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his own men! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on to nobody.</span><span class="c4">...</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t a been in that ring-master&rsquo;s place, not for a thousand dollars.&rdquo; As with Hemingway&rsquo;s minimalist short stories and clipped vignettes in In Our Time (1925), the reader rather than the author must undertake the interpretation. The author simply sketches a situation, in Twain&rsquo;s book through Huck&rsquo;s naive eyes, and then compels the reader to carry out the task of construing its meaning. This is the breakthrough feat that Hemingway recognized Twain had achieved for later American writers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.fqbcmwi8pz0l"><span class="c16">UNDERESTIMATING HUCKLEBERRY FINN</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">It is possible to suppose that the main point of Huckleberry Finn is how its title character ultimately learns to view Jim as a fellow human being with valid feelings about his family and his future. That way of reading the novel is a principal reason why the boys&rsquo; ridiculous antics at the Phelps farm upset so many critics; Huck seems to fall back from the progress he had made in affirming Jim&rsquo;s humanity and friendship. But we make a large mistake in merely settling for Huck&rsquo;s discovery that his fellow passenger on the raft is sensitive and caring. What Twain presents is a far more complex proposition</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that it is conformist and cowardly of us to take it for granted that prevailing laws and customs, no matter how solidly established, are too sacred to be skeptically examined and intellectually tested by each of us as individuals. And this truly subversive slant to the novel challenges readers to ponder whether or not they themselves might be succumbing to social pressures by participating in practices that are in vogue and yet tremendously wrong. Twain was able to write about this sort of blindness so convincingly because he recalled how he himself had gone along with the institution of slavery through his adolescence and beyond, blithely overlooking manifold signs of its ethical and spiritual immorality.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">Mark Twain wrote and published another boy book, The Prince and the Pauper: A Tale for Young People of All Ages (1881), in the interval between </span><span class="c7 c4">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c7 c4">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(note that Twain dropped the definite article &ldquo;The &rdquo; from the title page of the latter book, presumably to better fit Huck&rsquo;s vernacular narrative). That middle novel, The Prince and the Pauper</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;though certainly worth reading, largely relied on Twain&rsquo;s research in English history books and lacks the sense of &ldquo;lived&rdquo; experience that animates his pictures in Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn of the Mississippi River, its villages, and its vessels. There are no other American books in the last half of the nineteenth century that offer a reader the pleasures of Twain&rsquo;s two companion boy books with their ingenuity of plot and characterization, slice-of-life sharpness, penetrating irony, and sweepingly panoramic display of an entire sector of society.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.ybbx6rnndy85"><span class="c16">THE RAFTSMEN EPISODE IN HUCKLEBERRY FINN</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">One other editorial choice had to be determined. Scholars have vigorously debated whether a lengthy passage in the manuscript of Huckleberry Finn that Twain first published in Chapter 3 of Life on the Mississippi (1883) to illustrate the rawness of early river days should be reinserted into the novel from which it was extracted. In this adventure Huck swims to a large raft and listens while &ldquo;a mighty rough looking lot&rdquo; of raftsmen drink, argue, sing, dance, and swap yarns. The men discover Huck in his hiding place, threaten to &ldquo;paint him a sky blue all over from head to heel,&rdquo; but let him go with a stern warning. Mark Twain agreed to delete the episode from Huckleberry Finn for fear that the public might think he was duplicating &ldquo;old matter&rdquo; (Twain&rsquo;s words) in his new book (since he had used it previously in Life on the Mississippi ) and because the publisher pointed out that Huckleberry Finn was longer than Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;damaging the impression that they were companion volumes.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">The author yielded to his publisher&rsquo;s suggestion on April 22, 1884 so obligingly (&ldquo;Yes, I think the raft chapter can be left wholly out&rdquo;) that most subsequent editions of the novel have followed suit. The NewSouth Edition incorporates the raftsmen passage into Chapter 16 as Twain initially wrote it in his manuscript and published it in the American edition of Life on the Mississippi</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;That episode, with its strutting, pugnacious braggarts and its chilling ghost tale about a child&rsquo;s murder, contains some of Mark Twain&rsquo;s best writing. Its inclusion enables readers to savor more of Twain contributions to the then-reigning &ldquo;Local Color&rdquo; school of fiction that prized vivid descriptions of an area&rsquo;s vocations and peculiarities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.7zvgyqyvm0lx"><span class="c16">TEXTUAL EMENDATIONS</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">With the exception of the changes in racial denotations (and in four archaic references to skin color) and the insertion of the raftsmen passage, the text of the novel otherwise follows the wording of the first American edition. Issues about questionable punctuation were resolved by consulting a facsimiles of Twain&rsquo;s manuscript. The editor has silently modernized certain eccentricities of nineteenth-century punctuation and spelling, and has given American spellings preference over British spellings. Obvious typographical errors introduced by the printers and inconsistent spellings have been corrected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c22" id="h.px3v7icm35j5"><span class="c16">ALTERNATIVE EDITIONS</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">It goes without saying that textual purists object strenuously to these editorial alterations of an author&rsquo;s final manuscript, especially regarding key racial denominators. (For confirmation of this reaction, see the editor&rsquo;s essay, &ldquo;Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer Go Back to School,&rdquo; Independent Publisher 29, v [May 2011], as well as CBS&rsquo;s &ldquo;60 Minutes&rdquo; segment devoted to the NewSouth Edition that aired on March 20, 2011.) However, the fact of the matter is that literally dozens of other editions are available (including several published by NewSouth Books) for those readers who prefer Twain&rsquo;s original phrasing. Those standard editions will always exist. Even better, Twain&rsquo;s holograph manuscript of </span><span class="c7 c4">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is now viewable in a CD issued in 2003 by the Buffalo and Erie County Public Library.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c1">This NewSouth Edition of Huckleberry Finn is emphatically not intended for academic scholars.

Aunt Polly</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Tom&rsquo;s Aunt Polly, she is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and Mary, and the Widow Douglas, is all told about in that book</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which is mostly a true book; with some stretchers, as I said before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Now the way that the book winds up, is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollars apiece</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher, he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece, all the year round</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas, she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn&rsquo;t stand it no longer, I lit out. I got into my old rags, and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer, he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called a me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn&rsquo;t do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. When you got to the table you couldn&rsquo;t go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn&rsquo;t really anything the matter with them. That is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers; and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by-and-by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn&rsquo;t care no more about him; because I don&rsquo;t take no stock in dead people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn&rsquo;t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn&rsquo;t clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They all get down on a thing when they don&rsquo;t know nothing about it. Here she was a bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now, with a spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn&rsquo;t stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t scrunch up like that, Huckleberry</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">set up straight;&rdquo; and pretty soon she would say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">why don&rsquo;t you try to behave?&rdquo; Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad, then, but I didn&rsquo;t mean no harm. All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn&rsquo;t particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn&rsquo;t say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn&rsquo;t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn&rsquo;t try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn&rsquo;t do no good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn&rsquo;t think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and, she said, not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. By-and-by they fetched the slaves in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn&rsquo;t no use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars was shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me and I couldn&rsquo;t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that&rsquo;s on its mind and can&rsquo;t make itself understood, and so can&rsquo;t rest easy in its grave and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared, I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn&rsquo;t need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn&rsquo;t no confidence. You do that when you&rsquo;ve lost a horse-shoe that you&rsquo;ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn&rsquo;t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you&rsquo;d killed a spider.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I set down again, a shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death, now, and so the widow wouldn&rsquo;t know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">boom</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">boom</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">twelve licks</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and all still again</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap, down in the dark amongst the trees</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a &ldquo;me-yow! me-yow! &rdquo; down there. That was good! Says I, &ldquo;me-yow! me-yow! &rdquo; as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window onto the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in amongst the trees, and sure enough there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c15 c38" id="h.2ga69hwxw8by"><span class="c24 c9 c19"></span></h2><h2 class="c15" id="h.hrwe0jdp040u"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 2</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We went tip-toeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow&rsquo;s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn&rsquo;t scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson&rsquo;s big slave, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who dah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He listened some more; then he come tip-toeing down and stood right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn&rsquo;t a sound, and we all there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching; but I dasn&rsquo;t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. Seemed like I&rsquo;d die if I couldn&rsquo;t scratch. Well, I&rsquo;ve noticed that thing plenty of times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain&rsquo;t sleepy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">if you are anywheres where it won&rsquo;t do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Say</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn&rsquo; hear sumf&rsquo;n. Well, I knows what I&rsquo;s gwyne to do. I&rsquo;s gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. But I dasn&rsquo;t scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn&rsquo;t know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn&rsquo;t stand it more&rsquo;n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tom he made a sign to me</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">kind of a little noise with his mouth</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off, Tom whispered to me and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun; but I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they&rsquo;d find out I warn&rsquo;t in. Then Tom said he hadn&rsquo;t got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn&rsquo;t want him to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As soon as Tom was back, we cut along the path, around the, garden fence, and by-and-by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house. Tom said he slipped Jim&rsquo;s hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn&rsquo;t wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by-and-by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn&rsquo;t hardly notice the other slaves. Slaves would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any slave in that country. Strange slaves would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Slaves is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, &ldquo;Hm ! What you know &rsquo;bout witches?&rdquo; and that slave was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece around his neck with a string and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to, just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Slaves would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn&rsquo;t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined, for a servant, because he got so stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hill-top, we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there was sick folks; maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Joe Harper, and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles and crawled in on our hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn&rsquo;t a noticed that there was a hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer&rsquo;s Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name in blood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it, and he mustn&rsquo;t eat and he mustn&rsquo;t sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band. And nobody that didn&rsquo;t belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot, forever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of pirate books, and robber books, and every gang that was high-toned had it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Huck Finn, he hain&rsquo;t got no family</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what you going to do &rsquo;bout him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, hain&rsquo;t he got a father?&rdquo; says Tom Sawyer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s got a father, but you can&rsquo;t never find him, these days. He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain&rsquo;t been seen in these parts for a year or more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of anything to do</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they could kill her. Everybody said:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll do, she&rsquo;ll do. That&rsquo;s all right. Huck can come in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark on the paper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says Ben Rogers, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the line of business of this Gang?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nothing only robbery and murder,&rdquo; Tom said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But who are we going to rob? houses</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">or cattle</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">or</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain&rsquo;t robbery, it&rsquo;s burglary,&rdquo; says Tom Sawyer. &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t burglars. That ain&rsquo;t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Must we always kill the people?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, certainly. It&rsquo;s best. Some authorities think different, but mostly it&rsquo;s considered best to kill them. Except some that you bring to the cave here and keep them till they&rsquo;re ransomed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ransomed? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But that&rsquo;s what they do. I&rsquo;ve seen it in books; and so of course that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But how can we do it if we don&rsquo;t know what it is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why blame it all, we&rsquo;ve got to do it. Don&rsquo;t I tell you it&rsquo;s in the books? Do you want to go to doing different from what&rsquo;s in the books, and get things all muddled up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all very fine to say, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don&rsquo;t know how to do it to them? that&rsquo;s the thing I want to get at. Now what do you reckon it is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t know. But per&rsquo;aps if we keep them till they&rsquo;re ransomed, it means that we keep them till they&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s something like. That&rsquo;ll answer. Why couldn&rsquo;t you said that before? We&rsquo;ll keep them till they&rsquo;re ransomed to death</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and a bothersome lot they&rsquo;ll be, too, eating up everything and always trying to get loose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there&rsquo;s a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A guard. Well, that is good. So somebody&rsquo;s got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that&rsquo;s foolishness. Why can&rsquo;t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because it ain&rsquo;t in the books so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s why. Now Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don&rsquo;t you?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s the idea. Don&rsquo;t you reckon that the people that made the books knows what&rsquo;s the correct thing to do? Do you reckon you can learn &rsquo;em anything? Not by a good deal. No, sir, we&rsquo;ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right. I don&rsquo;t mind; but I say it&rsquo;s a fool way, anyhow. Say</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">do we kill the women, too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn&rsquo;t let on. Kill the women? No</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You fetch them to the cave, and you&rsquo;re always as polite as pie to them; and by-and-by they fall in love with you and never want to go home any more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s the way, I&rsquo;m agreed, but I don&rsquo;t take no stock in it. Mighty soon we&rsquo;ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won&rsquo;t be no place for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain&rsquo;t got nothing to say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Little Tommy Barnes was asleep, now, and when they waked him up he was scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn&rsquo;t want to be a robber any more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and meet next week and rob somebody and kill some people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ben Rogers said he couldn&rsquo;t get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing. They agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Joe Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.tqzugc4ati2n"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 3</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, I got a good going-over in the morning, from old Miss Watson, on account of my clothes; but the widow she didn&rsquo;t scold, but only cleaned off the grease and clay and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave a while if I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every day, and whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn&rsquo;t so. I tried it. Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn&rsquo;t any good to me without hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I couldn&rsquo;t make it work. By-and-by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to try for me, but she said I was a fool. She never told me why, and I couldn&rsquo;t make it out no way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I set down, one time, back in the woods, and had a long think about it. I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don&rsquo;t Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can&rsquo;t the widow get back her silver snuff-box that was stole? Why can&rsquo;t Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to myself, there ain&rsquo;t nothing in it. I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was &ldquo;spiritual gifts.&rdquo; This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn&rsquo;t see no advantage about it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">except for the other people</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">so at last I reckoned I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body&rsquo;s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow&rsquo;s Providence, but if Miss Watson&rsquo;s got him there warn&rsquo;t no help for him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow&rsquo;s, if he wanted me, though I couldn&rsquo;t make out how he was agoing to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was so ignorant and so kind of low-down and ornery.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Pap he hadn&rsquo;t been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable for me; I didn&rsquo;t want to see him no more. He used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around. Well, about this time he was found in the river drowned, about twelve mile above town, so people said. They judged it was him, anyway; said this drowned man was just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which was all like pap</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but they couldn&rsquo;t make nothing out of the face, because it had been in the water so long it warn&rsquo;t much like a face at all. They said he was floating on his back in the water. They took him and buried him on the bank. But I warn&rsquo;t comfortable long, because I happened to think of something. I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don&rsquo;t float on his back, but on his face. So I knowed, then, that this warn&rsquo;t pap, but a woman dressed up in a man&rsquo;s clothes. So I was uncomfortable again. I judged the old man would turn up again by-and-by, though I wished he wouldn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All the boys did. We hadn&rsquo;t robbed nobody, we hadn&rsquo;t killed any people, but only just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drovers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs &ldquo;ingots,&rdquo; and he called the turnips and stuff &ldquo;julery&rdquo; and we would go to the cave and pow-wow over what we had done and how many people we had killed and marked. But I couldn&rsquo;t see no profit in it. One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand &ldquo;sumter&rdquo; mules, all loaded down with di&rsquo;monds, and they didn&rsquo;t have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it; though they was only lath and broom-sticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted and then they warn&rsquo;t worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. I didn&rsquo;t believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word, we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn&rsquo;t no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn&rsquo;t no camels nor no elephants. It warn&rsquo;t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Joe Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in and made us drop everything and cut. I didn&rsquo;t see no di&rsquo;monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn&rsquo;t we see them, then? He said if I warn&rsquo;t so ignorant, but had read a book called &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; I would know without asking. He said it was all done by enchantment. He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians, and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday school, just out of spite. I said, all right, then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians. Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson. They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;s&rsquo;pose we got some genies to help us</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;can&rsquo;t we lick the other crowd then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How you going to get them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. How do they get them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the smoke a-rolling, and everything they&rsquo;re told to do they up and do it. They don&rsquo;t think nothing of pulling a shot tower up by the roots, and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">or any other man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who makes them tear around so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. They belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, and they&rsquo;ve got to do whatever he says. If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long, out of di&rsquo;monds, and fill it full of chewing gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor&rsquo;s daughter from China for you to marry, they&rsquo;ve got to do it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and they&rsquo;ve got to do it before sun-up next morning, too. And more</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they&rsquo;ve got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I think they are a pack of flatheads for not keeping the palace themselves &rsquo;stead of fooling them away like that. And what&rsquo;s more</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How you talk, Huck Finn. Why, you&rsquo;d have to come when he rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? All right, then; I would come; but I lay I&rsquo;d make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shucks, it ain&rsquo;t no use me to talk to you, Huck Finn. You don&rsquo;t seem to know anything, somehow</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">perfect sap-head.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I would see if there was anything in it. I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an Indian, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn&rsquo;t no use, none of the genies come. So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom Sawyer&rsquo;s lies. I reckoned he believed in the A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. It had all the marks of a Sunday school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c15 c38" id="h.q2qg6tkd3mcv"><span class="c24 c9 c19"></span></h2><h2 class="c15" id="h.l5p192t6pjab"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.l5p192t6pjab">Chapter 4</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter, now. I had been to school most all the time, and could spell, and read, and write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five, and I don&rsquo;t reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever. I don&rsquo;t take no stock in mathematics, anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">At first I hated the school, but by-and-by I got so I could stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hooky, and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow&rsquo;s ways, too, and they warn&rsquo;t so raspy on me. Living in a house, and sleeping in a bed, pulled on me pretty tight, mostly, but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods, sometimes, and so that was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she warn&rsquo;t ashamed of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. I reached for some of it as quick as I could, to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off. She says, &ldquo;Take your hands away, Huckleberry</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what a mess you are always making.&rdquo; The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn&rsquo;t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn&rsquo;t one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I went down the front garden and clumb over the stile, where you go through the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the ground, and I seen somebody&rsquo;s tracks. They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden fence. It was funny they hadn&rsquo;t come in, after standing around so. I couldn&rsquo;t make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. I didn&rsquo;t notice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my shoulder it every now and then, but I didn&rsquo;t see nobody. I was at Judge Thatcher&rsquo;s as quick as I could get there. He said:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. Did you come for your interest?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;is there some for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in, last night. Over a hundred and fifty dollars. Quite a fortune for you. You better let me invest it along with your six thousand because if you take it you&rsquo;ll spend it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to spend it. I don&rsquo;t want it at all</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">nor the six thousand, nuther. I want you to take it; I want to give it to you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the six thousand and all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He looked surprised. He couldn&rsquo;t seem to make it out. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, what can you mean, my boy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ask me no questions about it, please. You&rsquo;ll take it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m puzzled. Is something the matter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please take it,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t ask me nothing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">then I won&rsquo;t have to tell no lies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He studied a while, and then he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oho-o. I think I see. You want to sell all your property to me</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">not give it. That&rsquo;s the correct idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you see it says &lsquo;for a consideration.&rsquo; That means I have bought it of you and paid you for it. Here&rsquo;s a dollar for you. Now, you sign it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I signed it, and left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Miss Watson&rsquo;s slave, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do magic with it. He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed everything. So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again, for I found his tracks in the snow. What I wanted to know, was, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? Jim got out his hair-ball, and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch. Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same. Jim got down on his knees and put his ear against it and listened. But it warn&rsquo;t no use; he said it wouldn&rsquo;t talk. He said sometimes it wouldn&rsquo;t talk without money. I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn&rsquo;t no good because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn&rsquo;t pass nohow, even if the brass didn&rsquo;t show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time. (I reckoned I wouldn&rsquo;t say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t know the difference. Jim smelt it, and bit it, and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good. He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next morning you couldn&rsquo;t see no brass, and it wouldn&rsquo;t feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potato would do that, before, but I had forgot it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball and got down and listened again. This time he said the hair-ball was all right. He said it would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to. I says, go on. So the hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; ole father doan&rsquo; know, yit, what he&rsquo;s a-gwyne to do.

Then I turned around, and there he was. I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much. I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken. That is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">he being so unexpected; but right away after, I see I warn&rsquo;t scared of him worth bothering about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He was most fifty, and he looked it. His hair was long and tangled and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines. It was all black, no gray; so was his long, mixed-up whiskers. There warn&rsquo;t no color in his face, where his face showed; it was white; not like another man&rsquo;s white, but a white to make a body sick, a white to make a body&rsquo;s flesh crawl</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white. As for his clothes</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">just rags, that was all. He had one ankle resting on &rsquo;tother knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then. His hat was laying on the floor; an old black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair tilted back a little.

I never see such a son.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something they give me for learning my lessons good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He tore it up, and says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you something better</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll give you a cowhide.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you a sweet-scented dandy, though? A bed; and bedclothes; and a look&rsquo;n-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard. I bet I&rsquo;ll take some o&rsquo; these frills out o&rsquo; you before I&rsquo;m done with you. Why there ain&rsquo;t no end to your airs</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they say you&rsquo;re rich. Hey? </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">how&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They lie</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s how.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looky here</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">mind how you talk to me; I&rsquo;m a-standing about all I can stand, now</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">so don&rsquo;t gimme no sass. I&rsquo;ve been in town two days, and I hain&rsquo;t heard nothing but about you bein&rsquo; rich. I heard about it away down the river, too. That&rsquo;s why I come. You git me that money tomorrow</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I want it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t got no money.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie. Judge Thatcher&rsquo;s got it. You git it. I want it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t got no money, I tell you. You ask Judge Thatcher; he&rsquo;ll tell you the same.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll ask him; and I&rsquo;ll make him pungle, too, or I&rsquo;ll know the reason why. Say</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">how much you got in your pocket? I want it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t got only a dollar, and I want that to</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make no difference what you want it for</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you just shell it out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky; said he hadn&rsquo;t had a drink all day. When he had got out on the shed, he put his head in again, and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I reckoned he was gone, he come back and put his head in again, and told me to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn&rsquo;t drop that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher&rsquo;s and bullyragged him and tried to make him give up the money, but he couldn&rsquo;t, and then he swore he&rsquo;d make the law force him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that had just come, and he didn&rsquo;t know the old man; so he said court mustn&rsquo;t interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he&rsquo;d druther not take a child away from its father. So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That pleased the old man till he couldn&rsquo;t rest. He said he&rsquo;d cowhide me till I was black and blue if I didn&rsquo;t raise some money for him. I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got drunk and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed him again for a week. But he said he was satisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he&rsquo;d make it warm for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make a man of him. So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just old pie to him, so to speak. And after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he&rsquo;d been a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was agoing to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him. The judge said he could hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap said he&rsquo;d been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the judge said he believed it. The old man said that what a man wanted that was down, was sympathy; and the judge said it was so; so they cried again. And when it was bedtime, the old man rose up and held out his hand, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look at it gentlemen, and ladies all; take ahold of it; shake it. There&rsquo;s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain&rsquo;t so no more; it&rsquo;s the hand of a man that&rsquo;s started in on a new life, and &rsquo;ll die before he&rsquo;ll go back. You mark them words</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">don&rsquo;t forget I said them. It&rsquo;s a clean hand now; shake it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">don&rsquo;t be afeard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. The judge&rsquo;s wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a pledge</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">made his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in the night sometime he got powerful thirsty and clumb out onto the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And when they come to look at that spare room, they had to take soundings before they could navigate it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned a body could reform the ole man with a shot-gun, maybe, but he didn&rsquo;t know no other way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c15 c32" id="h.labmdjpg93h"><span class="c24 c9 c19"></span></h2><h2 class="c15 c41" id="h.c4r9azl1hh73"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 6</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or out-run him most of the time. I didn&rsquo;t want to go to school much, before, but I reckoned I&rsquo;d go now to spite pap. That law trial was a slow business; appeared like they warn&rsquo;t ever going to get started on it; so every now and then I&rsquo;d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just suited</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">this kind of thing was right in his line.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He got to hanging around the widow&rsquo;s too much, and so she told him at last, that if he didn&rsquo;t quit using around there she would make trouble for him. Well, wasn&rsquo;t he mad? He said he would show who was Huck Finn&rsquo;s boss. So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about three mile, in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn&rsquo;t no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn&rsquo;t find it if you didn&rsquo;t know where it was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off. We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key under his head, nights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where I was, by-and-by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me, but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn&rsquo;t long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it, all but the cowhide part.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;d ever got to like it so well at the widow&rsquo;s, where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever bothering over a book and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time. I didn&rsquo;t want to go back no more. I had stopped cussing, because the widow didn&rsquo;t like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn&rsquo;t no objections. It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it all around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But by-and-by pap got too handy with his hick&rsquo;ry, and I couldn&rsquo;t stand it. I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drowned and I wasn&rsquo;t ever going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn&rsquo;t find no way. There warn&rsquo;t a window to it big enough for a dog to get through. I couldn&rsquo;t get up the chimbly, it was too narrow. The door was thick solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was &rsquo;most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind, from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the blanket and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out, big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap&rsquo;s gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Pap warn&rsquo;t in a good humor</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">so he was his natural self. He said he was down to town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money, if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there&rsquo;d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win, this time. This shook me up considerable, because I didn&rsquo;t want to go back to the widow&rsquo;s any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn&rsquo;t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn&rsquo;t know the names of, and so called them what&rsquo;s-his-name, when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off, to stow me in, where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn&rsquo;t find me. That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn&rsquo;t stay on hand till he got that chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn&rsquo;t stay in one place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn&rsquo;t ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. I got so full of it I didn&rsquo;t notice how long I was staying, till the old man a hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body would a thought he was Adam, he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor begun to work, he most always went for the govment. This time he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it&rsquo;s like. Here&rsquo;s the law a-standing ready to take a man&rsquo;s son away from him</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">a man&rsquo;s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin&rsquo; for him and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they call that govment! That ain&rsquo;t all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o&rsquo; my property. Here&rsquo;s what the law does. The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and upards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round in clothes that ain&rsquo;t fitten for a hog. They call that govment! A man can&rsquo;t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I&rsquo;ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I told &rsquo;em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of &rsquo;em heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I&rsquo;d leave the blamed country and never come anear it agin. Them&rsquo;s the very words. I says, look at my hat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">if you call it a hat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it&rsquo;s below my chin, and then it ain&rsquo;t rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o&rsquo; stove-pipe. Look at it, says I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">such a hat for me to wear</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">one of the wealthiest men in this town, if I could git my rights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free slave there, from Ohio; a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain&rsquo;t a man in that town that&rsquo;s got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And what do you think? they said he was a p&rsquo;fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain&rsquo;t the wust. They said he could vote, when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was &rsquo;lection day, and I was just about to go and vote, myself, if I warn&rsquo;t too drunk to get there; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they&rsquo;d let that slave vote, I drawed out. I says I&rsquo;ll never vote agin. Them&rsquo;s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see the cool way of that slave</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">why, he wouldn&rsquo;t a give me the road if I hadn&rsquo;t shoved him out o&rsquo; the way. I says to the people, why ain&rsquo;t this slave put up at auction and sold?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s what I want to know. And what do you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn&rsquo;t be sold till he&rsquo;d been in the State six months, and he hadn&rsquo;t been there that long yet. There, now</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s a specimen. They call that a govment that can&rsquo;t sell a free slave till he&rsquo;s been in the State six months. Here&rsquo;s a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet&rsquo;s got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take ahold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free slave, and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Pap was agoing on so, he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork, and barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">mostly hove at the slave and the govment, though he give the tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it warn&rsquo;t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body&rsquo;s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous. He said so his own self, afterwards. He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself out, one or &rsquo;tother. He drank, and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets, by-and-by; but luck didn&rsquo;t run my way. He didn&rsquo;t go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned, and moaned, and thrashed around this way and that, for a long time. At last I got so sleepy I couldn&rsquo;t keep my eyes open, all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning. I don&rsquo;t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up. There was pap, looking wild and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but I couldn&rsquo;t see no snakes. He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering &ldquo;take him off! take him off! he&rsquo;s biting me on the neck!&rdquo; I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over, wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming, and saying there was devils ahold of him. He wore out, by-and-by, and laid still a while moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn&rsquo;t make a sound. I could hear the owls and the wolves, away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By-and-by he raised up, part way, and listened, with his head to one side. He says very low:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tramp</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">tramp</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">tramp; that&rsquo;s the dead; tramp</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">tramp</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">tramp; they&rsquo;re coming after me; but I won&rsquo;t go</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Oh, they&rsquo;re here! don&rsquo;t touch me</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">don&rsquo;t! hands off</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they&rsquo;re cold; let go</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Oh, let a poor devil alone!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them to let him alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could hear him through the blanket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">By-and-by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place, with a clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death and saying he would kill me and then I couldn&rsquo;t come for him no more. I begged, and told him I was only Huck, but he laughed such a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So he dozed off, pretty soon. By-and-by I got the old split-bottom chair and clumb up, as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the gun. I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, and then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down behind it to wait for him to stir. And how slow and still the time did drag along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c15 c38" id="h.1f06rqvnlpr5"><span class="c24 c9 c19"></span></h2><h2 class="c15" id="h.6v7nln7xn86q"><span class="c48 c50"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 7</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Git up! what you &rsquo;bout!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over me, looking sour</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and sick, too. He says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What you doin&rsquo; with this gun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I judged he didn&rsquo;t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you roust me out?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well I tried to, but I couldn&rsquo;t; I couldn&rsquo;t budge you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, all right. Don&rsquo;t stand there palavering all day, but out with you and see if there&rsquo;s a fish on the lines for breakfast. I&rsquo;ll be along in minute.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He unlocked the door and I cleared out, up the river bank. I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would have great times, now, if I was over at the town. The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins, here comes cord-wood floating down, and pieces of log rafts</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">sometimes a dozen logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood yards and the sawmill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and &rsquo;tother one out for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once, here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck. I shot head first off of the bank, like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected there&rsquo;d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they&rsquo;d raise up and laugh at him. But it warn&rsquo;t so this time. It was a drift-canoe, sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">she&rsquo;s worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn&rsquo;t in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea; I judged I&rsquo;d hide her good, and then, stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I&rsquo;d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path apiece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn&rsquo;t seen anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When he got along, I was hard at it taking up a &ldquo;trot&rdquo; line. He abused me a little for being so slow, but I told him I fell in the river and that was what made me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. We got five cat-fish off of the lines and went home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">While we laid off, after breakfast, to sleep up, both of us being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck get far enough off before they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn&rsquo;t see no way for a while, but by-and-by pap raised up a minute, to drink another barrel of water, and he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Another time a man comes a-prowling round here, you roust me out. You hear? That man warn&rsquo;t here for no good. I&rsquo;d a shot him. Next time, you roust me out, you hear?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he dropped down and went to sleep again</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but what he had been saying give me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now so nobody won&rsquo;t think of following me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">About twelve o&rsquo;clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of drift-wood going by on the rise. By-and-by along comes part of a log raft</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">nine logs fast together. We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but that warn&rsquo;t pap&rsquo;s style. Nine logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked me in and took the skiff and started off towing the raft about half-past three. I judged he wouldn&rsquo;t come back that night. I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start, then I out with my saw and went to work on that log again. Before he was &rsquo;tother side of the river I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with the side of bacon; then the whisky jug; I took all the coffee and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the bucket and gourd, I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I took fish-lines and matches and other things</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn&rsquo;t any, only the one out at the wood pile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I had wore the ground a good deal, crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">for it was bent up at that place, and didn&rsquo;t quite touch ground. If you stood four or five foot away and didn&rsquo;t know it was sawed, you wouldn&rsquo;t ever notice it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin and it warn&rsquo;t likely anybody would go fooling around there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was all grass clear to the canoe; so I hadn&rsquo;t left a track. I followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the river. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods and was hunting around for some birds, when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I took the axe and smashed in the door</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I beat it and hacked it considerable, a-doing it. I fetched the pig in and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I say ground, because it was ground</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">hard packed, and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">all I could drag</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and I started it from the pig and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there, I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and bloodied the axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn&rsquo;t drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe and fetched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn&rsquo;t no knives and forks on the place</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">pap done everything with his clasp-knife, about the cooking. Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side, that went miles away, I don&rsquo;t know where, but it didn&rsquo;t go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped pap&rsquo;s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn&rsquo;t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was about dark, now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by-and-by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself, they&rsquo;ll follow the track of pipe, that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they&rsquo;ll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won&rsquo;t the ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They&rsquo;ll soon get tired of it that, and won&rsquo;t bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson&rsquo;s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town, nights, and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson&rsquo;s Island&rsquo;s the place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed, I was asleep. When I woke up I didn&rsquo;t know where I was, for a minute. I set up and looked around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a slipping along, black and still, hundred of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and smelt late. You know what I mean</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t know the words to put it in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start, when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it&rsquo;s a still night. I peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">a skiff, away across the water. I couldn&rsquo;t tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn&rsquo;t but one man in it. Thinks I, maybe it&rsquo;s pap, though I warn&rsquo;t expecting him. He dropped below me, with the current, and by-and-by he come a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him, him. Well, it was pap, sure enough</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and sober, too, by the way he laid to his oars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing and people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the drift-wood and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float. I laid there and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away into the sky, not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too, every word of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights, now. &rsquo;Tother one said this warn&rsquo;t one of the short ones, he reckoned</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and then they laughed, and he said it over again and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn&rsquo;t laugh; he ripped out something brisk and said let him alone. The first fellow said he &rsquo;lowed to tell it to his old woman</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn&rsquo;t nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it was nearly three o&rsquo;clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn&rsquo;t wait more than about a week longer. After that, the talk got further and further away, and I couldn&rsquo;t make out the words any more, but I could hear the mumble; and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was away below the ferry now. I rose up and there was Jackson&rsquo;s Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy-timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. There warn&rsquo;t any signs of the bar at the head</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it was all under water, now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It didn&rsquo;t take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood, and away over to the town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A monstrous big lumber raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, &ldquo;Stern oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!&rdquo; I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was a little gray in the sky, now; so I stepped into the woods and laid down for a nap before breakfast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.nilawxl64k1l"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 8</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The sun was up so high when I waked, that I judged it was after eight o&rsquo;clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade, thinking about things and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was powerful lazy and comfortable</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">didn&rsquo;t want to get up and cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again, when I thinks I hears a deep sound of &ldquo;boom!&rdquo; away up the river. I rouses up and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">about abreast the ferry. And there was the ferry-boat full of people, floating along down. I knowed what was the matter, now. &ldquo;Boom!&rdquo; I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferry-boat&rsquo;s side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to the top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was pretty hungry, but it warn&rsquo;t going to do for me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide, there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders, if I only had a bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves any of bread and float them off because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there. So says I, I&rsquo;ll keep a lookout, and if any of them&rsquo;s floating around after me, I&rsquo;ll give them a show. I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I warn&rsquo;t disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I most got it, with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I knowed enough for that. But by-and-by along comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was &ldquo;baker&rsquo;s bread&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what the quality eat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">none of your low-down corn-pone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone and done it. So there ain&rsquo;t no doubt but there is something in that thing. That is, there&rsquo;s something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don&rsquo;t work for me, and I reckon it don&rsquo;t work for only just the right kind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watching. The ferry-boat was floating with the current, and I allowed I&rsquo;d have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in close, where the bread did. When she&rsquo;d got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place. Where the log forked I could peep through.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">By-and-by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat. Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Joe Harper, and Tom Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he&rsquo;s washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water&rsquo;s edge. I hope so, anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see them first-rate, but they couldn&rsquo;t see me. Then the captain sung out:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stand away!&rdquo; and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I judged I was gone. If they&rsquo;d a had some bullets in, I reckon they&rsquo;d a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn&rsquo;t hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island. I could hear the booming, now and then, further and further off, and by-and-by after an hour, I didn&rsquo;t hear it no more. The island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up. But they didn&rsquo;t yet a while. They turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side, under steam, and booming once in a while as they went. I crossed over to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn&rsquo;t get at them. I catched a cat-fish and haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty satisfied; but by-and-by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on the bank and listened to the currents washing along, and counted the stars and drift-logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed; there ain&rsquo;t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can&rsquo;t stay so, you soon get over it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And so for three days and nights. No difference</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">just the same thing. But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer-grapes, and green razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They would all come handy by-and-by, I judged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn&rsquo;t far from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn&rsquo;t shot nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good sized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tip-toes as fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second, amongst the thick leaves, and listened; but my breath come so hard I couldn&rsquo;t hear nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again; and so on, and so on; if I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I got to camp I warn&rsquo;t feeling very brash, there warn&rsquo;t much sand in my craw; but I says, this ain&rsquo;t no time to be fooling around. So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year&rsquo;s camp, and then clumb a tree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn&rsquo;t see nothing, I didn&rsquo;t hear nothing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I only thought I heard and seen as much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn&rsquo;t stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good and dark, I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night, when I hear a plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people&rsquo;s voices. I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn&rsquo;t got far when I hear a man say:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We better camp here, if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out. Let&rsquo;s look around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t sleep much. I couldn&rsquo;t, somehow, for thinking. And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn&rsquo;t do me no good. By-and-by I says to myself, I can&rsquo;t live this way; I&rsquo;m agoing to find out who it is that&rsquo;s here on the island with me; I&rsquo;ll find it out or bust. Well, I felt better, right off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I poked along well onto an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep. Well by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods. I set down there on a log and looked out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch and the darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the tree-tops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn&rsquo;t no luck, somehow; I couldn&rsquo;t seem to find the place. But by-and-by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire, away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By-and-by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting gray daylight, now. Pretty soon he gapped, and stretched himself, and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson&rsquo;s Jim! I bet I was glad to see him. I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello, Jim!&rdquo; and skipped out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his knees, and puts his hands together and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Doan&rsquo; hurt me</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">don&rsquo;t! I hain&rsquo;t ever done no harm to a ghos&rsquo;. I awluz liked dead people, en done all I could for &rsquo;em. You go en git in de river agin, whah you b&rsquo;longs, en doan&rsquo; do nuffn to Ole Jim, &rsquo;at &rsquo;uz awluz yo&rsquo; fren&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, I warn&rsquo;t long making him understand I warn&rsquo;t dead. I was ever so glad to see Jim. I warn&rsquo;t lonesome, now. I told him I warn&rsquo;t afraid of him telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me never said nothing. Then I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good daylight. Le&rsquo;s get breakfast. Make up your camp fire good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s de use er makin&rsquo; up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain&rsquo;t you? Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Strawberries and such truck,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Is that what you live on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo; git nuffn else,&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I come heah de night arter you&rsquo;s killed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, all that time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes-indeedy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And ain&rsquo;t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, sah</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">nuffn else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you must be most starved, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I reck&rsquo;n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de islan&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Since the night I got killed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No! W&rsquo;y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun. Dat&rsquo;s good. Now you kill sumfn en I&rsquo;ll make up de fire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the slave was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft. I catched a good big cat-fish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When breakfast was ready, we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot. Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">By-and-by Jim says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat &rsquo;uz killed in dat shanty, ef it warn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom Sawyer couldn&rsquo;t get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How do you come to be here, Jim, and how&rsquo;d you get here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He looked pretty uneasy, and didn&rsquo;t say nothing for a minute. Then he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe I better not tell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Jim?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, dey&rsquo;s reasons. But you wouldn&rsquo; tell on me ef I &rsquo;uz to tell you, would you, Huck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Blamed if I would, Jim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I b&rsquo;lieve you, Huck.

I said I wouldn&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;ll stick to it. Honest, I will. People would call me a low down Ablitionist and despise me for keeping mum</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but that don&rsquo;t make no difference. I ain&rsquo;t agoing to tell, and I ain&rsquo;t agoing back there anyways. So now, le&rsquo;s know all about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you see, it &rsquo;uz dis way. Ole Missus</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">dat&rsquo;s Miss Watson</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she wouldn&rsquo; sell me down to Orleans.

Well, one night I creeps to de do&rsquo;, pooty late, en de do&rsquo; warn&rsquo;t quite shet, en I hear ole missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she didn&rsquo; want to, but she could git eight hund&rsquo;d dollars for me, en it &rsquo;uz sich a big stack o&rsquo; money she couldu&rsquo; resis&rsquo;. De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn&rsquo; do it, but I never waited to hear de res&rsquo;. I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I tuck out en shin down de hill en &rsquo;spec to steal a skift &rsquo;long de sho&rsquo; som&rsquo;ers &rsquo;bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirrin&rsquo; yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go &rsquo;way. Well, I wuz dah all night.

Dese las&rsquo; skifts wuz full o&rsquo; ladies en genlmen agoin&rsquo; over for to see de place. Sometimes dey&rsquo;d pull up at de sho&rsquo; en take a res&rsquo; b&rsquo;fo&rsquo; dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to know all &rsquo;bout de killin&rsquo;. I &rsquo;uz powerful sorry you&rsquo;s killed, Huck, but I ain&rsquo;t no mo&rsquo;, now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I laid dah under de shavins all day.

De yuther servants wouldn&rsquo; miss me, kase dey&rsquo;d shin out en take holiday, soon as de ole folks &rsquo;uz out&rsquo;n de way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went &rsquo;bout two mile er more to whah dey warn&rsquo;t no houses.

You see ef I kep&rsquo; on tryin&rsquo; to git away afoot, de dogs &rsquo;ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey&rsquo;d miss dat skift, you see, en dey&rsquo;d know &rsquo;bout whah I&rsquo;d lan&rsquo; on de yuther side en whah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I&rsquo;s arter; it doan&rsquo; make no track.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I see a light a-comin&rsquo; roun&rsquo; de p&rsquo;int, bymeby, so I wade&rsquo; in en shove&rsquo; a log ahead o&rsquo; me, en swum more&rsquo;n half-way acrost de river, en got in &rsquo;mongst de drift-wood, en kep&rsquo; my head down low, en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along.

I see um go by heah; watched um thoo de bushes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he rekoned it was the same way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn&rsquo;t let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said his father would die, and he did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And Jim said you musn&rsquo;t count the things you are going to cook for dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a bee-hive, and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim said bees wouldn&rsquo;t sting idiots; but I didn&rsquo;t believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn&rsquo;t sting me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn&rsquo;t any good-luck signs. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mighty few</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">an&rsquo; dey ain&rsquo; no use to a body.

Well, dey&rsquo;s some use in a sign like dat, &rsquo;kase it&rsquo;s so fur ahead. You see, maybe you&rsquo;s got to be po&rsquo; a long time fust, en so you might git discourage&rsquo; en kill yo&rsquo;sef &rsquo;f you didn&rsquo; know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s de use to ax dat question? don&rsquo; you see I has?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, are you rich?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin.

De cow up &rsquo;n&rsquo; died on my han&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So you lost the ten dollars.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo; lose it all.

Well, all de slaves went in, but dey didn&rsquo; have much. I wuz de on&rsquo;y one dat had much. So I stuck out for mo&rsquo; dan fo&rsquo; dollars, en I said &rsquo;f I didn&rsquo; git it I&rsquo;d start a bank mysef. Well o&rsquo; course dat slave want&rsquo; to keep me out er de business, bekase he say dey warn&rsquo;t business &rsquo;nough for two banks, so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en&rsquo; er de year.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So I done it.

We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by-and-by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there, right away, but I said we didn&rsquo;t want to be climbing up and down there all the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and they would never find us without dogs. And besides, he said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast the cavern, and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and a good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c13">We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there. We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty soon it darkened up and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and blackest</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">fst! it was as bright as glory and you&rsquo;d have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about, away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now you&rsquo;d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling down the sky towards the under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs, where it&rsquo;s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jim, this is nice,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be nowhere else but here. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t a ben here, &rsquo;f it hadn&rsquo;t a ben for Jim. You&rsquo;d a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn&rsquo; mos&rsquo; drownded, too, dat you would, honey. Chickens knows when its gwyne to rain, en so do do birds, chile.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c13 c4">The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side it was a good many miles wide; but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c13 c4">a half a mile</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c13 c4">Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe. It was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods even if the sun was blazing outside. We went winding in and out amongst the trees; and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old broken-down tree, you could see rabbits, and snakes, and such things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two, they got so tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they would slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in, was full of them. We could a had pets enough if we&rsquo;d wanted them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c13 c4">One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">nice pine planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the top stood above water six or seven inches, a solid level floor. We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight, sometimes, but we let them go; we didn&rsquo;t show ourselves in daylight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c13 c4">Another night, when we was up at the head of the island, just before daylight, here comes a frame house down, on the west side. She was a two-story, and tilted over, considerable. We paddled out and got aboard</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">clumb in at an upstairs window. But it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then we looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table, and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor and there was clothes hanging against the wall. There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello, you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But it didn&rsquo;t budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c13 c4">&ldquo;De man ain&rsquo;t asleep</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c13 c4">he&rsquo;s dead. You hold still</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll go en see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He went and bent down and looked, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c13 c4">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He&rsquo;s ben shot in de back. I reck&rsquo;n he&rsquo;s ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan&rsquo; look at his face</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it&rsquo;s too gashly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he needn&rsquo;t done it; I didn&rsquo;t want to see him. There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black cloth ; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures, made with charcoal. There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some women&rsquo;s under-clothes, hanging against the wall, and some men&rsquo;s clothing, too. We put the lot into the canoe; it might come good. There was a boy&rsquo;s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that too. And there was a bottle that had had milk in it; and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck. We would a took the bottle, but it was broke. There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke. They stood open, but there warn&rsquo;t nothing left in them that was any account. The way things was scattered about, we reckoned the people left in a hurry and warn&rsquo;t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher knife without any handle, and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty old bed-quilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fish-line as thick as my little finger, with some monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a horse-shoe, and some vials of medicine that didn&rsquo;t have no label on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. The straps was broke off of it, but barring that, it; was a good enough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn&rsquo;t find the other one, though we hunted all around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready to shove off, we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt, because if he set up, people could tell he was a slave a good ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn&rsquo;t no accidents and didn&rsquo;t see nobody. We got home all safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.einau74mns8"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 10</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed, but Jim didn&rsquo;t want to. He said it would fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha&rsquo;nt us; he said a man that warn&rsquo;t buried was more likely to go a-ha&rsquo;nting around than one that was planted and comfortable. That sounded pretty reasonable, so I didn&rsquo;t say no more; but I couldn&rsquo;t keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We rummaged the clothes we&rsquo;d got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. Jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because if they&rsquo;d a knowed the money was there they wouldn&rsquo;t a left it. I said I reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn&rsquo;t want to talk about that. I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now you think it&rsquo;s bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday? You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin with my hands. Well, here&rsquo;s your bad luck! We&rsquo;ve raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides. I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day, Jim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Never you mind, honey, never you mind. Don&rsquo;t you git too peart. It&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo;. Mind I tell you, it&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. Well, after dinner Friday, we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some, and found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on the foot of Jim&rsquo;s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there&rsquo;d be some fun when Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all about the snake, and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light, the snake&rsquo;s mate was there, and bit him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a second with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap&rsquo;s whisky jug and begun to pour it down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told me to chop off the snake&rsquo;s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn&rsquo;t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so did his leg; but by-and-by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I&rsquo;d druther been bit with a snake than pap&rsquo;s whisky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn&rsquo;t ever take aholt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn&rsquo;t got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I&rsquo;ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do. Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot tower and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn&rsquo;t see it. Pap told me. But anyway, it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a cat-fish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn&rsquo;t handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach, and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there was a spool in it. Jim said he&rsquo;d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn&rsquo;t ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat&rsquo;s as white as snow and makes a good fry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a stirring up, some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said, couldn&rsquo;t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl? That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico gowns and I turned up my trowser-legs to my knees and got into it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pie. Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and by-and-by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn&rsquo;t walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches pocket. I took notice, and done better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I started across to the town from a little below the ferry landing, and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I tied up and started along the bank. There was a light burning in a little shanty that hadn&rsquo;t been lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters there. I slipped up and peeped in at the window. There was a woman about forty year old in there, knitting by a candle that was on a pine table. I didn&rsquo;t know her face; she was a stranger, for you couldn&rsquo;t start a face in that town that I didn&rsquo;t know. Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn&rsquo;t forget I was a girl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.43pfhvhxa9pn"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 11</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; says the woman, and I did. She says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Take a cheer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I done it. She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says &ldquo;What might your name be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sarah Williams.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where &rsquo;bouts do you live? In this neighborhood?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No&rsquo;m. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I&rsquo;ve walked all the way and I&rsquo;m all tired out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hungry, too, I reckon. I&rsquo;ll find you something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No&rsquo;m, I ain&rsquo;t hungry. I was so hungry I had to stop two mile below here at a farm; so I ain&rsquo;t hungry no more. It&rsquo;s what makes me so late. My mother&rsquo;s down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore. He lives at the upper end of the town, she says. I hain&rsquo;t ever been here before. Do you know him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No; but I don&rsquo;t know everybody yet. I haven&rsquo;t lived here quite two weeks. It&rsquo;s a considerable ways to the upper end of the town. You better stay here all night. Take off your bonnet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rest a while, I reckon, and go on. I ain&rsquo;t afeard of the dark.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She said she wouldn&rsquo;t let me go by myself, but her husband would be in by-and-by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she&rsquo;d send him along with me. Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better off they used to was, and how they didn&rsquo;t know but they&rsquo;d made a mistake coming to our town, instead of letting well alone</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town; but by-and-by she dropped onto pap and the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along. She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered. I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who done it ? We&rsquo;ve heard considerable about these goings on, down in Hookerville, but we don&rsquo;t know who &rsquo;twas that killed Huck Finn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I reckon there&rsquo;s a right smart chance of people here that&rsquo;d like to know who killed him. Some thinks old Finn done it himself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">is that so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Most everybody thought it at first. He&rsquo;ll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched. But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway slave named Jim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why he </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. She run on, and never noticed I had put in at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The slave run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. So there&rsquo;s a reward out for him</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">three hundred dollars. And there&rsquo;s a reward out for old Finn too</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">two hundred dollars. You see, he come to town the morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with &rsquo;em on the ferry-boat hunt, and right away after he up and left. Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see. Well, next day they found out the slave was gone; they found out he hadn&rsquo;t ben seen sence ten o&rsquo;clock the night the murder was done. So then they put it on him, you see, and while they was full of it, next day back comes old Finn and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the slave all over Illinois with. The judge give him some, and that evening he got drunk and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard looking strangers, and then went off with them. Well, he hain&rsquo;t come back sence, and they ain&rsquo;t looking for him back till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he&rsquo;d get Huck&rsquo;s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit. People do say he warn&rsquo;t any too good to do it. Oh, he&rsquo;s sly, I reckon. If he don&rsquo;t come back for a year, he&rsquo;ll be all right. You can&rsquo;t prove anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and he&rsquo;ll walk into Huck&rsquo;s money as easy as nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I reckon so, &rsquo;m. I don&rsquo;t see nothing in the way of it. Has everybody quit thinking the slave done it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks he done it. But they&rsquo;ll get the slave pretty soon, now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, are they after him yet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re innocent, ain&rsquo;t you! Does three hundred dollars lay round every day for people to pick up? Some folks thinks the slave ain&rsquo;t far from here. I&rsquo;m one of them</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but I hain&rsquo;t talked it around. A few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson&rsquo;s Island. Don&rsquo;t anybody live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn&rsquo;t say any more, but I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I&rsquo;d seen smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says to myself, like as not that slave&rsquo;s hiding over there; anyway, says I, it&rsquo;s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt. I hain&rsquo;t seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he&rsquo;s gone, if it was him; but husband&rsquo;s going over to see</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">him and another man. He was gone up the river; but he got back today and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I had got so uneasy I couldn&rsquo;t set still. I had to do something with my hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When the woman stopped talking, I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious, and smiling a little. I put down the needle and thread and let on to be interested</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and I was, too</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Three hundred dollars is a power of money. I wish my mother could get it. Is your husband going over there tonight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes. He went up town with the man I was telling you of, to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun. They&rsquo;ll go over after midnight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t they see better they was to wait till daytime?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. And couldn&rsquo;t the slave see better, too? After midnight he&rsquo;ll likely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark, if he&rsquo;s got one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn&rsquo;t feel a bit comfortable. Pretty soon she says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you say your name was, honey?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;M</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Mary Williams.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Somehow it didn&rsquo;t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn&rsquo;t look up; seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered, and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too. I wished the woman would say something more; the longer she set still, the uneasier I was. But now she says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes&rsquo;m, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah&rsquo;s my first name. Some calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the way of it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was feeling better, then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. I couldn&rsquo;t look up yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place, and so forth, and so on, and then I got easy again. She was right about the rats. You&rsquo;d see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while. She said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn&rsquo;t give her no peace. She showed me a bar of lead, twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot with it generly, but she&rsquo;d wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn&rsquo;t know whether she could throw true, now. But she watched for a chance, and directly she banged away at a rat, but she missed him wide, and said &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn&rsquo;t let on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if he&rsquo;d a stayed where he was he&rsquo;d a been a tolerable sick rat. She said that that was first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back and brought along a hank of yarn, which she wanted me to help her with. I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them and went on talking about her and her husband&rsquo;s matters. But she broke off to say:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap, handy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So she dropped the lump into my lap, just at that moment, and I clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, but very pleasant, and, says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come, now</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what&rsquo;s your real name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wh-what, mum?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">or what is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn&rsquo;t know, hardly what to do. But I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please to don&rsquo;t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. If I&rsquo;m in the way, here, I&rsquo;ll</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t. Set down and stay where you are. I ain&rsquo;t going to hurt you, and I ain&rsquo;t going to tell on you, nuther. You just tell me your secret, and trust me. I&rsquo;ll keep it; and what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll help you. So&rsquo;ll my old man, if you want him to. You see, you&rsquo;re a runaway &rsquo;prentice</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s all. It ain&rsquo;t anything. There ain&rsquo;t any harm in it. You&rsquo;ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut. Bless you, child, I wouldn&rsquo;t tell on you. Tell me all about it, now</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s a good boy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I said it wouldn&rsquo;t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she mustn&rsquo;t go back on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn&rsquo;t stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance and stole some of his daughter&rsquo;s old clothes, and cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles; I traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way and I had a plenty. I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Goshen, child? This ain&rsquo;t Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen&rsquo;s ten mile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He was drunk I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain&rsquo;t no matter now. I got to be moving along. I&rsquo;ll fetch Goshen before daylight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on a minute. I&rsquo;ll put you up a snack to eat. You might want it.&rdquo; So she put me up a snack, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Say</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">when a cow&rsquo;s laying down, which end of her gets up first? Answer up prompt, now</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">don&rsquo;t stop to study over it. Which end gets up first?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The hind end, mum.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, a horse?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The for&rsquo;rard end, mum.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Which side of a tree does the most moss grow on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;North side.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The whole fifteen, mum.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I reckon you have lived in the country. I thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again. What&rsquo;s your real name, now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;George Peters, mum.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, try to remember it, George. Don&rsquo;t forget and tell me it&rsquo;s Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it&rsquo;s George-Elexander when I catch you. And don&rsquo;t go about women in that old calico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle, don&rsquo;t hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s the way a woman most always does; but a man always does &rsquo;tother way. And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tip-toe, and fetch your hand up over your head as awkard as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy. And mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap, she throws her knees apart; she don&rsquo;t clap them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead. Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived the other things just to make certain. Now trot along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I&rsquo;ll do what I can to get you out of it. Keep the river road, all the way, and next time you tramp, take shoes and socks with you. The river road&rsquo;s a rocky one, and your feet&rsquo;ll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. I jumped in and was off in a hurry. I went up stream far enough to make the head of the island, and then started across. I took off the sun-bonnet, for I didn&rsquo;t want no blinders on, then. When I was about the middle, I hear the clock begin to strike; so I stops and listens; the sound come faint over the water, but clear</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">eleven. When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started a good fire there on a high-and-dry spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place a mile and a half below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern. There Jim laid, sound asleep on the ground. I roused him out and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Git up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain&rsquo;t a minute to lose. They&rsquo;re after us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By that time everything we had in the world was on our raft and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn&rsquo;t show a candle outside after that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I took the canoe out from shore a little piece and took a look, but if there was a boat around I couldn&rsquo;t see it, for stars and shadows ain&rsquo;t good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still, never saying a word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.o33fg7tjpoep"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 12</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It must a been close onto one o&rsquo;clock when we got below the island at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come along, we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn&rsquo;t come, for we hadn&rsquo;t ever thought to put the gun into the canoe, or a fishing-line or anything to eat. We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. It warn&rsquo;t good judgment to put everything on the raft.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If the men went to the island, I just expect they found the camp fire I built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn&rsquo;t no fault of mine. I played it as low-down on them as I could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When the first streak of day begun to show, we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cotton-wood branches with the hatchet and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there. A towhead is a sand-bar that has cotton-woods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn&rsquo;t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with in that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn&rsquo;t set down and watch a camp fire</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">no, sir, she&rsquo;d fetch a dog. Well, then, I said, why couldn&rsquo;t she tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he believed they must a gone up town to get a dog and so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn&rsquo;t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again. So I said I didn&rsquo;t care what was the reason they didn&rsquo;t get us, as long as they didn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When it was beginning to come on dark, we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket and looked up, and down, and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of the reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra steering oar, too, because one of the others might get broke, on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on; because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn&rsquo;t have to light it for upstream boats unless we see we was in what they call a &ldquo;crossing;&rdquo; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn&rsquo;t always run the channel, but hunted easy water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish, and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn&rsquo;t ever feel like talking loud, and it warn&rsquo;t often that we laughed, only a little kind of a low chuckle. We had mighty good weather, as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all, that night, nor the next, nor the next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights, not a house could you see. The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o&rsquo;clock that still night. There warn&rsquo;t a sound there; everybody was asleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Every night, now, I used to slip ashore, towards ten o&rsquo;clock, at some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents&rsquo; worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn&rsquo;t roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don&rsquo;t want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain&rsquo;t ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn&rsquo;t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Mornings, before daylight, I slipped into corn fields and borrowed a watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of that kind. Pap always said it warn&rsquo;t no harm to borrow things, if you was meaning to pay them back, sometime; but the widow said it warn&rsquo;t anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it. Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we wouldn&rsquo;t borrow them any more</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">then he reckoned it wouldn&rsquo;t be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons, or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p&rsquo;simmons. We warn&rsquo;t feeling just right, before that, but it was all comfortable now. I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain&rsquo;t ever good, and the p&rsquo;simmons wouldn&rsquo;t be ripe for two or three months yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We shot a water-fowl, now and then, that got up too early in the morning or didn&rsquo;t go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all around, we lived pretty high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high rocky bluffs on both sides. By-and-by says I, &ldquo;HeI-lo</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jim, looky yonder!&rdquo; It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it when the flashes come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, it being away in the night, and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what there was there. So I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Le&rsquo;s land on her, Jim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But Jim was dead against it, at first. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I doan&rsquo; want to go fool&rsquo;n &rsquo;long er no wrack. We&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; blame&rsquo; well, en we better let blame&rsquo; well alone, as de good book says. Like as not dey&rsquo;s a watchman on dat wrack.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Watchman your grandmother,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody&rsquo;s going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when it&rsquo;s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?&rdquo; Jim couldn&rsquo;t say nothing to that, so he didn&rsquo;t try. &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;we might borrow something worth having, out of the captain&rsquo;s stateroom. Seegars, I bet you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and they don&rsquo;t care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can&rsquo;t rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? Not for pie, he wouldn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;d call it an adventure</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;d call it and he&rsquo;d land on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn&rsquo;t he throw style into it?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">wouldn&rsquo;t he spread himself, nor nothing? Why, you&rsquo;d think it was Christopher C&rsquo;lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer was here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn&rsquo;t talk any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning showed us the wreck again, just in time, and we fetched the starboard derrick, and made fast there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The deck was high out, here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so dark we couldn&rsquo;t see no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight, and clumb onto it; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain&rsquo;s door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come along. I says, all right; and was going to start for the raft; but just then I heard a voice wail out and say</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t, boys; I swear I won&rsquo;t ever tell!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Another voice said, pretty loud:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie, Jim Turner. You&rsquo;ve acted this way before. You always want more&rsquo;n your share of the truck, and you&rsquo;ve always got it, too, because you&rsquo;ve swore &rsquo;t if you didn&rsquo;t you&rsquo;d tell. But this time you&rsquo;ve said it jest one time too many. You&rsquo;re the meanest, treacherousest hound in this country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">By this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn&rsquo;t back out now, and so I won&rsquo;t either; I&rsquo;m agoing to see what&rsquo;s going on here. So I dropped on my hands and knees, in the little passage, and crept aft in the dark, till there warn&rsquo;t but about one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. Then, in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol. This one kept pointing the pistol at the man&rsquo;s head on the floor and saying</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to! And I orter, too, a mean skunk!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The man on the floor would shrivel up, and say: &ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t, Bill</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I hain&rsquo;t ever goin&rsquo; to tell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And every time he said that, the man with the lantern would laugh, and say:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed you ain&rsquo;t! You never said no truer thing &rsquo;n that, you bet you.&rdquo; And once he said: &ldquo;Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn&rsquo;t got the best of him and tied him, he&rsquo;d a killed us both, And what for? Jist for noth&rsquo;n. Jist because we stood on our rights</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that&rsquo;s what for. But I lay you ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. Put up that pistol, Bill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Bill says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to, Jake Packard. I&rsquo;m for killin&rsquo; him</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and didn&rsquo;t he kill old Hatfield jist the same way</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and don&rsquo;t he deserve it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want him killed, and I&rsquo;ve got my reasons for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bless yo&rsquo; heart for them words, Jake Packard! I&rsquo;ll never forgit you, long&rsquo;s I live!&rdquo; says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Packard didn&rsquo;t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail, and started towards where I was, there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come. I crawfished as fast as I could, about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn&rsquo;t make very good time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The man come a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard&rsquo; got to my stateroom, he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">come in here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in, I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn&rsquo;t see them, but I could tell where they was, by the whisky they&rsquo;d been having. I was glad I didn&rsquo;t drink whisky; but it wouldn&rsquo;t made much difference, anyway, because most of the time they couldn&rsquo;t a treed me because I didn&rsquo;t breathe. I was too scared. And besides, a body couldn&rsquo;t breathe, and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s said he&rsquo;ll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares to him now, it wouldn&rsquo;t make no difference after the row, and the way we&rsquo;ve served him. Shore&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re born, he&rsquo;ll turn State&rsquo;s evidence; now you hear me. I&rsquo;m for putting him out of his troubles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So&rsquo;m I,&rdquo; says Packard, very quiet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Blame it, I&rsquo;d sorter begun to think you wasn&rsquo;t. Well, then, that&rsquo;s all right. Les&rsquo; go and do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on a minute; I hain&rsquo;t had my say yit. You listen to me. Shooting&rsquo;s good, but there&rsquo;s quieter ways if the thing&rsquo;s got to be done. But what I say, is this; it ain&rsquo;t good sense to go court&rsquo;n around after a halter, if you can git at what you&rsquo;re up to in some way that&rsquo;s jist as good and at the same time don&rsquo;t bring you into no resks. Ain&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You bet it is. But how you goin&rsquo; to manage it this time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, my idea is this: we&rsquo;ll rustle around and gether up whatever pickins we&rsquo;ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck. Then we&rsquo;ll wait. Now I say it ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to be more &rsquo;n two hours befo&rsquo; this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See? He&rsquo;ll be drownded, and won&rsquo;t have nobody to blame for it but his own self. I reckon that&rsquo;s a considerble sight better&rsquo;n killin&rsquo; of him. I&rsquo;m unfavorable to killin&rsquo; a man as long as you can git around it; it ain&rsquo;t good sense, it ain&rsquo;t good morals. Ain&rsquo;t I right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I reck&rsquo;n you are. But s&rsquo;pose she don&rsquo;t break up and wash off?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, we can wait the two hours, anyway, and see, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, then; come along.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said in a kind of a coarse whisper, &ldquo;Jim !&ldquo; and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a moan, and I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quick, Jim, it ain&rsquo;t no time for fooling around and moaning; there&rsquo;s a gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don&rsquo;t hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows can&rsquo;t get away from the wreck, there&rsquo;s one of &rsquo;em going to be in a bad fix.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But if we find their boat we can put all of &rsquo;em in a bad fix</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">for the Sheriff&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em. Quick</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">hurry! I&rsquo;ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You start at the raft, and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, my lordy, lordy! Raf&rsquo; ? Dey ain&rsquo; no raf&rsquo; no mo&rsquo;, she done broke loose en gone!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rsquo;en here we is!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h2 class="c15 c38" id="h.2a3zpa4ewsq9"><span class="c24 c9 c19"></span></h2><h2 class="c15" id="h.sj0bjme2xk02"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 13</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, I catched my breath and most fainted. Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that! But it warn&rsquo;t no time to be sentimentering. We&rsquo;d got to find that boat, now</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">had to have it for ourselves. So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was, too</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">seemed a week before we got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim said he didn&rsquo;t believe he could go any further</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">so scared he hadn&rsquo;t hardly any strength left, he said. But I said come on, if we get left on this wreck, we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled, again. We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door, there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been aboard of her; but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his head out, only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Heave that blame lantern out o&rsquo; sight, Bill!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself, and set down. It was Packard. Then Bill he come out and got in. Packard says, in a low voice</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All ready</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">shove off!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t hardly hang onto the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rsquo;d you go through him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. So he&rsquo;s got his share o&rsquo; the cash, yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, come along</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">no use to take truck and leave money.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Say</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">won&rsquo;t he suspicion what we&rsquo;re up to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe he won&rsquo;t. But we got to have it anyway. Come along.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So they got out and went in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The door slammed to, because it was on the careened side; and in a half second I was in the boat, and Jim come a tumbling after me. I out with my knife and cut the rope, and away we went!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We didn&rsquo;t touch an oar, and we didn&rsquo; speak nor whisper, nor hardly even breathe. We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When we was three or four hunIred yards down stream, we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door, for a second, and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble; now, as Jim Turner was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. Now was the first time that I begun to worry about the men</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I reckon I hadn&rsquo;t had time to before. I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix. I says to myself, there ain&rsquo;t no telling but I might come to be a murderer myself, yet, and then how would I like it? So says I to Jim:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The first light we see, we&rsquo;ll land a hundred yards below it or above it, in a place where it&rsquo;s a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and then I&rsquo;ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when their time comes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again, and this time worse than ever. The rain poured down, and never a light showed; everybody in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river, watching for lights and watching for our raft. After a long time the rain let up, but the clouds staid, and the lightning kept whimpering, and by-and-by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we made for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. We seen a light, now away down to the right, on shore. So I said I would go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole, there on the wreck. We hustled it onto the raft in a pile, and I told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light. As I got down towards it, three or four more showed</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in above the shore-light, and laid on my oars and floated. As I went by, I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferry-boat. I skimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by-and-by I found him roosting on the bitts, forward, with his head down between his knees. I give his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to cry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He stirred up, in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only me, he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello, what&rsquo;s up? Don&rsquo;t cry, bub. What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pap, and mam, and sis, and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then I broke down. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, dang it, now, don&rsquo;t take on so, we all has to have our troubles and this&rsquo;n&rsquo;ll come out all right. What&rsquo;s the matter with &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they&rsquo;re</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">are you the watchman of the boat?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says, kind, of pretty-well-satisfied like. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the captain and the owner, and the mate, and the pilot, and watchman, and head deck-hand; and sometimes I&rsquo;m the freight and passengers. I ain&rsquo;t as rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can&rsquo;t be so blame&rsquo; generous and good to Tom, Dick and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he does ; but I&rsquo;ve told him a many a time &rsquo;t I wouldn&rsquo;t trade places with him; for, says I, a sailor&rsquo;s life&rsquo;s the life for me, and I&rsquo;m derned if I&rsquo;d live two mile out o&rsquo; town, where there ain&rsquo;t nothing ever goin&rsquo; on, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it. Says I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I broke in and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in an awful peck of trouble, and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, pap, and mam, and sis, and Miss Hooker; and if you&rsquo;d take your ferry-boat and go up there</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Up where? Where are they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;On the wreck.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What wreck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, there ain&rsquo;t but one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, you don&rsquo;t mean the Walter Scott ?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good land! what are they doin&rsquo; there, for gracious sakes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, they didn&rsquo;t go there a-purpose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I bet they didn&rsquo;t ! Why, great goodness, there ain&rsquo;t no chance for &rsquo;em if they don&rsquo;t git off mighty quick! Why, how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Easy enough. Miss Hooker was a-visiting, up there to the town</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Booth&rsquo;s Landing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">go on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She was a-visiting, there at Booth&rsquo;s Landing, and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her slave woman in the horse-ferry, to stay all night at her friend&rsquo;s house, Miss What-you-may-call-her, I disremember her name, and they lost their steering-oar, and swung around and went a-floating down, stern-first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferry man and the slave woman and the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck. Well, about an hour after dark, we come along down in our trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn&rsquo;t notice the wreck till we was right on it; and so we saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and oh, he was the best cretur!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I most wish&rsquo;t it had been me, I do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My George ! It&rsquo;s the beatenest thing I ever struck. And then what did you all do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, we hollered and took on, but it&rsquo;s so wide there, we couldn&rsquo;t make nobody hear. So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it, and Miss Hooker she said if I didn&rsquo;t strike help sooner, come here and hunt up her uncle, and he&rsquo;d fix the thing. I made the land about a mile below, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do something, but they said, &lsquo;What, in such a night and such a current? there ain&rsquo;t no sense in it; go for the steam-ferry.&rsquo; Now if you&rsquo;ll go, and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;By Jackson, I&rsquo;d like to, and blame it I don&rsquo;t know but I will; but who in the dingnation&rsquo;s agoin&rsquo; to pay for it? Do you reckon your pap</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s all right. Miss Hooker she told me, particular, that her uncle Hornback</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Great guns! is he her uncle? Looky here, you break for that light over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a quarter of a mile out you&rsquo;ll come to the tavern; tell &rsquo;em to dart you out to Jim Hornback&rsquo;s and he&rsquo;ll foot the bill. And don&rsquo;t you fool around any, because he&rsquo;ll want to know the news. Tell him I&rsquo;ll have his niece all safe before he can get to town. Hump yourself, now; I&rsquo;m agoing up around the corner here, to roust out my engineer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among some woodboats; for I couldn&rsquo;t rest easy till I could see the ferry-boat start. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would a done it. I wished the widow knowed about it. I judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, before long, here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along down! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for her. She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn&rsquo;t much chance for anybody being alive in her. I pulled all around her and hollered a little, but there wasn&rsquo;t any answer; all dead still. I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they could stand it, I could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then here comes the ferry-boat; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach, I laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker&rsquo;s remainders, because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferry-boat give it up and went for shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It did seem a powerful long time before Jim&rsquo;s light showed up; and when it did show, it looked like it was a thousand mile off. By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned in and slept like dead people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.oobss8hei3pe"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 14</a></span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">By-and-by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three boxes of seegars. We hadn&rsquo;t ever been this rich before, in neither of our lives. The seegars was prime. We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good time. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck, and at the ferry-boat; and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said he didn&rsquo;t want no more adventures. He said that when I went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone, he nearly died; because he judged it was all up with him, anyway it could be fixed; for if he didn&rsquo;t get saved he would get drownded; and if he did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure. Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head, for a slave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I read considerable to Jim about kings, and dukes, and earls, and such, and how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, &rsquo;stead of mister; and Jim&rsquo;s eyes bugged out, and he was interested. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo; know dey was so many un um.

We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead to tie to, for it wouldn&rsquo;t do to try to run in fog; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line, to make fast, there warn&rsquo;t anything but little saplings to tie to. I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went. I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I couldn&rsquo;t budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and then there warn&rsquo;t no raft in sight; you couldn&rsquo;t see twenty yards. I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke. But she didn&rsquo;t come. I was in such a hurry I hadn&rsquo;t untied her. I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I couldn&rsquo;t hardly do anything with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right down the towhead. That was all right as far as it went, but the towhead warn&rsquo;t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn&rsquo;t no more idea which way I was going than a dead man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Thinks I, it won&rsquo;t do to paddle; first I know I&rsquo;ll run into the bank or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it&rsquo;s mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time. I whooped and listened. Away down there, somewheres, I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. I went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. The next time it come, I see I warn&rsquo;t heading for it but heading away to the right of it. And the next time, I was heading away to the left of it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and not gaining on it much, either, for I was flying around, this way and that and &rsquo;tother, but it was going straight ahead all the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop behind me. I was tangled good, now. That was somebody else&rsquo;s whoop, or else I was turned around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I kept answering, till by-and-by it was in front of me again and I knowed the current had swung the canoe&rsquo;s head down stream and I was all right, if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. I couldn&rsquo;t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don&rsquo;t look natural nor sound natural in a fog.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the current was tearing by them so swift.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set perfectly still, then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn&rsquo;t draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I just give up, then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone down &rsquo;tother side of it. It warn&rsquo;t no towhead, that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six mile long and more than a half a mile wide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I was floating along, of course, four or five mile an hour; but you don&rsquo;t ever think of that. No, you feel like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by, you don&rsquo;t think to yourself how fast you&rsquo;re going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag&rsquo;s tearing along. If you think it ain&rsquo;t dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way, by yourself, in the night, you try it once</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you&rsquo;ll see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn&rsquo;t do it, and directly I judged I&rsquo;d got into a nest of towheads, for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me, sometimes just a narrow channel between; and some that I couldn&rsquo;t see, I knowed was there, because I&rsquo;d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks. Well, I warn&rsquo;t long losing the whoops, down amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o-lantern. You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively, four or five times, to keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it was floating a little faster than what I was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, I seemed to be in the open river again, by-and-by, but I couldn&rsquo;t hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag, maybe, and it was all up with him. I was good and tired, so I laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn&rsquo;t bother no more. I didn&rsquo;t want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn&rsquo;t help it; so I thought I would take just one little cat-nap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a big bend stern first. First I didn&rsquo;t know where I was; I thought I was dreaming; and when things begun to come back to me, they seemed to come up dim out of last week.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see, by the stars. I looked away down stream, and seen a black speck on the water. I took out after it; but when I got to it it warn&rsquo;t nothing but a couple of saw-logs made fast together. Then I see another speck, and chased that; then another, and this time I was right. It was the raft.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering oar. The other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt. So she&rsquo;d had a rough time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I made fast and laid down under Jim&rsquo;s nose on the raft, and begun to gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn&rsquo;t you stir me up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck?

You been a drinking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Drinkin&rsquo;? Has I ben a drinkin&rsquo;? Has I had a chance to be a drinkin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How does I talk wild?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How ? why, hain&rsquo;t you been talking about my coming back, and all that stuff, as if I&rsquo;d been gone away?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huck</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye. Hain&rsquo;t you ben gone away?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gone away? Why, what in the nation do you mean? I hain&rsquo;t been gone anywheres. Where would I go to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, looky here, boss, dey&rsquo;s sumf&rsquo;n wrong, dey is.

Now dat&rsquo;s what I wants to know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I think you&rsquo;re here, plain enough, but I think you&rsquo;re a tangle-headed old fool, Jim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I is, is I? Well you answer me dis. Didn&rsquo;t you tote out de line in de canoe, for to make fas&rsquo; to de towhead?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t.

Looky here</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">didn&rsquo;t de line pull loose en de raf&rsquo; go a hummin&rsquo; down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What fog?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why de fog. Do fog dat&rsquo;s ben aroun&rsquo; all night. En didn&rsquo;t you whoop, en didn&rsquo;t I whoop, tell we got mix&rsquo; up in de islands en one un us got los&rsquo; en &rsquo;tother one was jis&rsquo; as good as los&rsquo;, &rsquo;kase he didn&rsquo; know whah he wuz?

You answer me dat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, this is too many for me, Jim. I hain&rsquo;t seen no fog, nor no islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing. I been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon I done the same. You couldn&rsquo;t a got drunk in that time, so of course you&rsquo;ve been dreaming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn&rsquo;t any of it happen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But Huck, it&rsquo;s all jis&rsquo; as plain to me as</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make no difference how plain it is, there ain&rsquo;t nothing in it. I know, because I&rsquo;ve been here all the time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim didn&rsquo;t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying over it. Then he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, den, I reck&rsquo;n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain&rsquo;t de powerfullest dream I ever see. En I hain&rsquo;t ever had no dream b&rsquo;fo&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s tired me like dis one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, well, that&rsquo;s all right, because a dream does tire a body like everything, sometimes. But this one was a staving dream</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">tell me all about it, Jim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as it happened, only he painted it up considerable. Then he said he must start in and &ldquo;&rsquo;terpret&rdquo; it, because it was sent for a warning. He said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but the current was another man that would get us away from him. The whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn&rsquo;t try hard to make out to understand them they&rsquo;d just take us into bad luck, &rsquo;stead of keeping us out of it. The lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome peop1e and all kinds of mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn&rsquo;t talk back and aggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn&rsquo;t have no more trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got onto the raft, but it was clearing up again, now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, well, that&rsquo;s all interpreted well enough, as far as it goes, Jim,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;but what does these things stand for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft, and the smashed oar. You could see them first rate, now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash again. He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldn&rsquo;t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again, right away. But when he did get the thing straightened around, he looked at me steady, without ever smiling, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do dey stan&rsquo; for? I&rsquo;s gwyne to tell you. When I got all wore out wid work, en wid de callin&rsquo; for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz mos&rsquo; broke bekase you wuz los&rsquo;, en I didn&rsquo; k&rsquo;yer no mo&rsquo; what become er me en de raf&rsquo;. En when I wake up en fine you back agin&rsquo;, all safe en soun&rsquo;, de tears come en I could a got down on my knees en kiss&rsquo; yo&rsquo; foot I&rsquo;s so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin &rsquo;bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. Dat truck dah is trash; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren&rsquo;s en makes &rsquo;em ashamed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he got up slow, and walked to the wigwam, and went in there, without saying anything but that. But that was enough. It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a slave</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but I done it, and I warn&rsquo;t ever sorry for it afterwards, neither. I didn&rsquo;t do him no more mean tricks, and I wouldn&rsquo;t done that one if I&rsquo;d a knowed it would make him feel that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.8nn4vdylxnwi"><span class="c48 c50"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 16</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. She had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. There was a power of style about her. It amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides; you couldn&rsquo;t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it. I said likely we wouldn&rsquo;t, because I had heard say there warn&rsquo;t but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn&rsquo;t happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show. But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and me too. So the question was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and waited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But you know a young person can&rsquo;t wait very well when he is impatient to find a thing out. We talked it over, and by and by Jim said it was such a black night, now, that it wouldn&rsquo;t be no risk to swim down to the big raft and crawl aboard and listen,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they would talk about Cairo, because they would be calculating to go ashore there for a spree, maybe, or anyway they would send boats ashore to buy whiskey or fresh meat or something. Jim had a wonderful level head, for a slave: he could most always start a good plan when you wanted one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I stood up and shook my rags off and jumped into the river, and struck out for the raft&rsquo;s light. By and by, when I got down nearly to her, I eased up and went slow and cautious. But everything was all right</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">nobody at the sweeps. So I swum down along the raft till I was most abreast the camp fire in the middle, then I crawled aboard and inched along and got in amongst some bundles of shingles on the weather side of the fire. There was thirteen men there</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they was the watch on deck of course. And a mighty rough-looking lot, too. They had a jug, and tin cups, and they kept the jug moving. One man was singing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">roaring, you may say; and it wasn&rsquo;t a nice song</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">for a parlor anyway. He roared through his nose, and strung out the last word of every line very long. When he was done they all fetched a kind of Indian war-whoop, and then another was sung. It begun:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There was a woman in our towdn,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In our towdn did dwed&rsquo;l (dwell,)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She loved her husband dear-i-lee,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But another man twyste as wed&rsquo;l.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Singing too, riloo, riloo, riloo,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ri-too, riloo, rilay - - - e,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She loved her husband dear-i-lee,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But another man twyste as wed&rsquo;l.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And so on</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">fourteen verses. It was kind of poor, and when he was going to start on the next verse one of them said it was the tune the old cow died on; and another one said, &ldquo;Oh, give us a rest.&rdquo; And another one told him to take a walk. They made fun of him till he got mad and jumped up and begun to cuss the crowd, and said he could lam any thief in the lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They was all about to make a break for him, but the biggest man there jumped up and says:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Set whar you are, gentlemen. Leave him to me; he&rsquo;s my meat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he jumped up in the air three times and cracked his heels together every time. He flung off a buckskin coat that was all hung with fringes, and says, &ldquo;You lay thar tell the chawin-up&rsquo;s done;&rdquo; and flung his hat down, which was all over ribbons, and says, &ldquo;You lay thar tell his sufferins is over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he jumped up in the air and cracked his heels together again and shouted out:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoo-oop! I&rsquo;m the old original iron-jawed, brass-mounted, copper-bellied corpse-maker from the wilds of Arkansaw! </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Look at me! I&rsquo;m the man they call Sudden Death and General Desolation! Sired by a hurricane, dam&rsquo;d by an earthquake, half-brother to the cholera, nearly related to the small-pox on the mother&rsquo;s side! Look at me! I take nineteen alligators and a bar&rsquo;l of whiskey for breakfast when I&rsquo;m in robust health, and a bushel of rattlesnakes and a dead body when I&rsquo;m ailing! I split the everlasting rocks with my glance, and I squench the thunder when I speak! Whoo-oop! Stand back and give me room according to my strength! Blood&rsquo;s my natural drink, and the wails of the dying is music to my ear! Cast your eye on me, gentlemen!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and lay low and hold your breath, for I&rsquo;m bout to turn myself loose!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">All the time he was getting this off, he was shaking his head and looking fierce, and kind of swelling around in a little circle, tucking up his wrist-bands, and now and then straightening up and beating his breast with his fist, saying, &ldquo;Look at me, gentlemen!&rdquo; When he got through, he jumped up and cracked his heels together three times, and let off a roaring &ldquo;whoo-oop! I&rsquo;m the bloodiest son of a wildcat that lives!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then the man that had started the row tilted his old slouch hat down over his right eye; then he bent stooping forward, with his back sagged and his south end sticking out far, and his fists a-shoving out and drawing in in front of him, and so went around in a little circle about three times, swelling himself up and breathing hard. Then he straightened, and jumped up and cracked his heels together three times before he lit again (that made them cheer), and he begun to shout like this:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoo-oop! bow your neck and spread, for the kingdom of sorrow&rsquo;s a-coming! Hold me down to the earth, for I feel my powers a-working! whoo-oop! I&rsquo;m a child of sin, don&rsquo;t let me get a start! Smoked glass, here, for all! Don&rsquo;t attempt to look at me with the naked eye, gentlemen! When I&rsquo;m playful I use the meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude for a seine, and drag the Atlantic Ocean for whales! I scratch my head with the lightning and purr myself to sleep with the thunder! When I&rsquo;m cold, I bile the Gulf of Mexico and bathe in it; when I&rsquo;m hot I fan myself with an equinoctial storm; when I&rsquo;m thirsty I reach up and suck a cloud dry like a sponge; when I range the earth hungry, famine follows in my tracks! Whoo-oop! Bow your neck and spread! I put my hand on the sun&rsquo;s face and make it night in the earth; I bite a piece out of the moon and hurry the seasons; I shake myself and crumble the mountains! Contemplate me through leather</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">don&rsquo;t use the naked eye! I&rsquo;m the man with a petrified heart and biler-iron bowels! The massacre of isolated communities is the pastime of my idle moments, the destruction of nationalities the serious business of my life! The boundless vastness of the great American desert is my enclosed property, and I bury my dead on my own premises!&rdquo; He jumped up and cracked his heels together three times before he lit (they cheered him again), and as he come down he shouted out: &ldquo;Whoo-oop! bow your neck and spread, for the pet child of calamity&rsquo;s a-coming!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then the other one went to swelling around and blowing again</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the first one</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the one they called Bob; next, the Child of Calamity chipped in again, bigger than ever; then they both got at it at the same time, swelling round and round each other and punching their fists most into each other&rsquo;s faces, and whooping and jawing like Indians; then Bob called the Child names, and the Child called him names back again: next, Bob called him a heap rougher names and the Child come back at him with the very worst kind of language; next, Bob knocked the Child&rsquo;s hat off, and the Child picked it up and kicked Bob&rsquo;s ribbony hat about six foot; Bob went and got it and said never mind, this warn&rsquo;t going to be the last of this thing, because he was a man that never forgot and never forgive, and so the Child better look out, for there was a time a-coming, just as sure as he was a living man, that he would have to answer to him with the best blood in his body. The Child said no man was willinger than he was for that time to come, and he would give Bob fair warning, now, never to cross his path again, for he could never rest till he had waded in his blood, for such was his nature, though he was sparing him now on account of his family, if he had one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Both of them was edging away in different directions, growling and shaking their heads and going on about what they was going to do; but a little black-whiskered chap skipped up and says:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come back here, you couple of chicken-livered cowards, and I&rsquo;ll thrash the two of ye!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And he done it, too. He snatched them, he jerked them this way and that, he booted them around, he knocked them sprawling faster than they could get up. Why, it warn&rsquo;t two minutes till they begged like dogs</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and how the other lot did yell and laugh and clap their hands all the way through, and shout &ldquo;Sail in, Corpse-Maker!&rdquo; &ldquo;Hi! at him again, Child of Calamity!&rdquo; &ldquo;Bully for you, little Davy!&rdquo; Well, it was a perfect pow-wow for a while. Bob and the Child had red noses and black eyes when they got through. Little Davy made them own up that they was sneaks and cowards and not fit to eat with a dog or drink with a slave; then Bob and the Child shook hands with each other, very solemn, and said they had always respected each other and was willing to let bygones be bygones. So then they washed their faces in the river; and just then there was a loud order to stand by for a crossing, and some of them went forward to man the sweeps there, and the rest went aft, to handle the after-sweeps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I laid still and waited for fifteen minutes, and had a smoke out of a pipe that one of them left in reach; then the crossing was finished, and they stumped back and had a drink around and went to talking and singing again. Next they got out an old fiddle, and one played, and another patted juba, and the rest turned themselves loose on a regular old-fashioned keel-boat break-down. They couldn&rsquo;t keep that up very long without getting winded, so by and by they settled around the jug again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They sung &ldquo;jolly, jolly raftsman&rsquo;s the life for me,&rdquo; with a rousing chorus, and then they got to talking about differences betwixt hogs, and their different kind of habits; and next about women and their different ways; and next about the best ways to put out houses that was afire; and next about what ought to be done with the Indians; and next about what a king had to do, and how much he got; and next about how to make cats fight; and next about what to do when a man has fits; and next about differences betwixt clear-water rivers and muddy-water ones. The man they called Ed said the muddy Mississippi water was wholesomer to drink than the clear water of the Ohio; he said if you let a pint of this yaller Mississippi water settle, you would have about a half to three quarters of an inch of mud in the bottom, according to the stage of the river, and then it warn&rsquo;t no better then Ohio water</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what you wanted to do was to keep it stirred up</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and when the river was low, keep mud on hand to put in and thicken the water up the way it ought to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The Child of Calamity said that was so; he said there was nutritiousness in the mud, and a man that drunk Mississippi water could grow corn in his stomach if he wanted to. He says:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You look at the graveyards; that tells the tale. Trees won&rsquo;t grow worth shucks in a Cincinnati graveyard, but in a Sent Louis graveyard they grow upwards of eight hundred foot high. It&rsquo;s all on account of the water the people drunk before they laid up. A Cincinnati corpse don&rsquo;t richen a soil any.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And they talked about how Ohio water didn&rsquo;t like to mix with Mississippi water. Ed said if you take the Mississippi on a rise when the Ohio is low, you&rsquo;ll find a wide band of clear water all the way down the east side of the Mississippi for a hundred mile or more, and the minute you get out a quarter of a mile from shore and pass the line, it is all thick and yaller the rest of the way across. Then they talked about how to keep tobacco from getting mouldy, and from that they went into ghosts and told about a lot that other folks had seen; but Ed says:--</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell something that you&rsquo;ve seen yourselves? Now let me have a say. Five years ago I was on a raft as big as this, and right along here it was a bright moonshiny night, and I was on watch and boss of the stabboard oar forrard, and one of my pards was a man named Dick Allbright, and he come along to where I was sitting, forrard</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">gaping and stretching, he was</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and stooped down on the edge of the raft and washed his face in the river, and come and set down by me and got out his pipe, and had just got it filled, when he looks up and says,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Why looky-here,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;ain&rsquo;t that Buck Miller&rsquo;s place, over yander in the bend?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;it is </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">why?&rsquo; He laid his pipe down and leant his head on his hand, and says,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought we&rsquo;d be furder down.&rsquo; I says,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought it too, when I went off watch&rsquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">we was standing six hours on and six off</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&lsquo;but the boys told me,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;that the raft didn&rsquo;t seem to hardly move, for the last hour,&rsquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">says I, &lsquo;though she&rsquo;s a slipping along all right, now,&rsquo; says I. He give a kind of a groan, and says,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seed a raft act so before, along here,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;&rsquo;pears to me the current has most quit above the head of this bend durin&rsquo; the last two years,&rsquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, he raised up two or three times, and looked away off and around on the water. That started me at it, too. A body is always doing what he sees somebody else doing, though there mayn&rsquo;t be no sense in it. Pretty soon I see a black something floating on the water away off to stabboard and quartering behind us. I see he was looking at it, too. I says,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; He says, sort of pettish,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t nothing but an old empty bar&rsquo;l.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;An empty bar&rsquo;l!&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;why,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;a spy-glass is a fool to your eyes. How can you tell it&rsquo;s an empty bar&rsquo;l?&rsquo; He says,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t know; I reckon it ain&rsquo;t a bar&rsquo;l, but I thought it might be,&rsquo; says he.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;so it might be, and it might be anything else, too; a body can&rsquo;t tell nothing about it, such a distance as that,&rsquo; I says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We hadn&rsquo;t nothing else to do, so we kept on watching it. By and by I says,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Why looky-here, Dick Allbright, that thing&rsquo;s a-gaining on us, I believe.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He never said nothing. The thing gained and gained, and I judged it must be a dog that was about tired out. Well, we swung down into the crossing, and the thing floated across the bright streak of the moonshine, and, by George, it was a bar&rsquo;l. Says I,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Dick Allbright, what made you think that thing was a bar&rsquo;l, when it was a half a mile off,&rsquo; says I. Says he,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; Says I,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;You tell me, Dick Allbright.&rsquo; He says,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I knowed it was a bar&rsquo;l; I&rsquo;ve seen it before; lots has seen it; they says it&rsquo;s a hanted bar&rsquo;l.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I called the rest of the watch, and they come and stood there, and I told them what Dick said. It floated right along abreast, now, and didn&rsquo;t gain any more. It was about twenty foot off. Some was for having it aboard, but the rest didn&rsquo;t want to. Dick Allbright said rafts that had fooled with it had got bad luck by it. The captain of the watch said he didn&rsquo;t believe in it. He said he reckoned the bar&rsquo;l gained on us because it was in a little better current than what we was. He said it would leave by and by.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So then we went to talking about other things, and we had a song, and then a breakdown; and after that the captain of the watch called for another song; but it was clouding up, now, and the bar&rsquo;l stuck right thar in the same place, and the song didn&rsquo;t seem to have much warm-up to it, somehow, and so they didn&rsquo;t finish it, and there warn&rsquo;t any cheers, but it sort of dropped flat, and nobody said anything for a minute. Then everybody tried to talk at once, and one chap got off a joke, but it warn&rsquo;t no use, they didn&rsquo;t laugh, and even the chap that made the joke didn&rsquo;t laugh at it, which ain&rsquo;t usual. We all just settled down glum, and watched the bar&rsquo;l, and was oneasy and oncomfortable. Well, sir, it shut down black and still, and then the wind begin to moan around, and next the lightning begin to play and the thunder to grumble. And pretty soon there was a regular storm, and in the middle of it a man that was running aft stumbled and fell and sprained his ankle so that he had to lay up. This made the boys shake their heads. And every time the lightning come, there was that bar&rsquo;l with the blue lights winking around it. We was always on the look-out for it. But by and by, towards dawn, she was gone. When the day come we couldn&rsquo;t see her anywhere, and we warn&rsquo;t sorry, neither.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But next night about half-past nine, when there was songs and high jinks going on, here she comes again, and took her old roost on the stabboard side. There warn&rsquo;t no more high jinks. Everybody got solemn; nobody talked; you couldn&rsquo;t get anybody to do anything but set around moody and look at the bar&rsquo;l. It begun to cloud up again. When the watch changed, the off watch stayed up, &rsquo;stead of turning in. The storm ripped and roared around all night, and in the middle of it another man tripped and sprained his ankle, and had to knock off. The bar&rsquo;l left towards day, and nobody see it go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everybody was sober and down in the mouth all day. I don&rsquo;t mean the kind of sober that comes of leaving liquor alone,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">not that. They was quiet, but they all drunk more than usual,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">not together,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but each man sidled off and took it private, by himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;After dark the off watch didn&rsquo;t turn in; nobody sung, nobody talked; the boys didn&rsquo;t scatter around, neither; they sort of huddled together, forrard; and for two hours they set there, perfectly still, looking steady in the one direction, and heaving a sigh once in a while. And then, here comes the bar&rsquo;l again. She took up her old place. She staid there all night; nobody turned in. The storm come on again, after midnight. It got awful dark; the rain poured down; hail, too; the thunder boomed and roared and bellowed; the wind blowed a hurricane; and the lightning spread over everything in big sheets of glare, and showed the whole raft as plain as day; and the river lashed up white as milk as far as you could see for miles, and there was that bar&rsquo;l jiggering along, same as ever. The captain ordered the watch to man the after sweeps for a crossing, and nobody would go,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">no more sprained ankles for them, they said. They would n&rsquo;t even walk aft. Well then, just then the sky split wide open, with a crash, and the lightning killed two men of the after watch, and crippled two more. Crippled them how, says you? Why, sprained their ankles!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The bar&rsquo;l left in the dark betwixt lightnings, towards dawn. Well, not a body eat a bite at breakfast that morning. After that the men loafed around, in twos and threes, and talked low together. But none of them herded with Dick Allbright. They all give him the cold shake. If he come around where any of the men was, they split up and sidled away. They wouldn&rsquo;t man the sweeps with him. The captain had all the skiffs hauled up on the raft, alongside of his wigwam, and wouldn&rsquo;t let the dead men be took ashore to be planted; he didn&rsquo;t believe a man that got ashore would come back; and he was right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;After night come, you could see pretty plain that there was going to be trouble if that bar&rsquo;l come again; there was such a muttering going on. A good many wanted to kill Dick Allbright, because he&rsquo;d seen the bar&rsquo;l on other trips, and that had an ugly look. Some wanted to put him ashore. Some said, let&rsquo;s all go ashore in a pile, if the bar&rsquo;l comes again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This kind of whispers was still going on, the men being bunched together forrard watching for the bar&rsquo;l, when, lo and behold you, here she comes again. Down she comes, slow and steady, and settles into her old tracks. You could a heard a pin drop. Then up comes the captain, and says:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Boys, don&rsquo;t be a pack of children and fools; I don&rsquo;t want this bar&rsquo;l to be dogging us all the way to Orleans, and you don&rsquo;t; well, then, how&rsquo;s the best way to stop it? Burn it up,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s the way. I&rsquo;m going to fetch it aboard,&rsquo; he says. And before anybody could say a word, in he went.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He swum to it, and as he come pushing it to the raft, the men spread to one side. But the old man got it aboard and busted in the head, and there was a baby in it! Yes sir, a stark naked baby. It was Dick Allbright&rsquo;s baby; he owned up and said so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he says, a-leaning over it, &lsquo;yes, it is my own lamented darling, my poor lost Charles William Allbright deceased,&rsquo; says he,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">for he could curl his tongue around the bulliest words in the language when he was a mind to, and lay them before you without a jint started, anywheres. Yes, he said he used to live up at the head of this bend, and one night he choked his child, which was crying, not intending to kill it,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which was prob&rsquo;ly a lie,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and then he was scared, and buried it in a bar&rsquo;l, before his wife got home, and off he went, and struck the northern trail and went to rafting; and this was the third year that the bar&rsquo;l had chased him. He said the bad luck always begun light, and lasted till four men was killed, and then the bar&rsquo;l didn&rsquo;t come any more after that. He said if the men would stand it one more night, </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and was a-going on like that,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but the men had got enough. They started to get out a boat to take him ashore and lynch him, but he grabbed the little child all of a sudden and jumped overboard with it hugged up to his breast and shedding tears, and we never see him again in this life, poor old suffering soul, nor Charles William neither.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who was shedding tears?&rdquo; says Bob; &ldquo;was it Allbright or the baby?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Allbright, of course; didn&rsquo;t I tell you the baby was dead? Been dead three years</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">how could it cry?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, never mind how it could cry</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">how could it keep all that time?&rdquo; says Davy. &ldquo;You answer me that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it done it,&rdquo; says Ed. &ldquo;It done it though</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s all I know about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Say</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what did they do with the bar&rsquo;l?&rdquo; says the Child of Calamity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, they hove it overboard, and it sunk like a chunk of lead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Edward, did the child look like it was choked?&rdquo; says one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did it have its hair parted?&rdquo; says another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What was the brand on that bar&rsquo;l, Eddy?&rdquo; says a fellow they called Bill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Have you got the papers for them statistics, Edmund?&rdquo; says Jimmy</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Say, Edwin, was you one of the men that was killed by the lightning?&rdquo; says Davy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Him? O, no, he was both of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; says Bob. Then they all haw-hawed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Say, Edward, don&rsquo;t you reckon you&rsquo;d better take a pill? You look bad</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">don&rsquo;t you feel pale?&rdquo; says the Child of Calamity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;O, come, now, Eddy,&rdquo; says Jimmy, &ldquo;show up; you must a kept part of that bar&rsquo;l to prove the thing by. Show us the bunghole</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">do </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and we&rsquo;ll all believe you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Say, boys,&rdquo; says Bill, &ldquo;less divide it up. Thar&rsquo;s thirteen of us. I can swaller a thirteenth of the yarn, if you can worry down the rest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ed got up mad and said they could all go to some place which he ripped out pretty savage, and then walked off aft cussing to himself, and they yelling and jeering at him, and roaring and laughing so you could hear them a mile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Boys, we&rsquo;ll split a watermelon on that,&rdquo; says the Child of Calamity; and he come rummaging around in the dark amongst the shingle bundles where I was, and put his hand on me. I was warm and soft and naked; so he says &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; and jumped back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fetch a lantern or a chunk of fire here, boys</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there&rsquo;s a snake here as big as a cow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So they run there with a lantern and crowded up and looked in on me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come out of that, you beggar!&rdquo; says one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; says another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you after here? Speak up prompt, or overboard you go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Snake him out, boys. Snatch him out by the heels.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I began to beg, and crept out amongst them trembling. They looked me over, wondering, and the Child of Calamity says:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A cussed thief! Lend a hand and less heave him overboard!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says Big Bob, &ldquo;less get out the paint-pot and paint him a sky blue all over from head to heel, and then heave him over!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good! that&rsquo;s it. Go for the paint, Jimmy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When the paint come, and Bob took the brush and was just going to begin, the others laughing and rubbing their hands, I begun to cry, and that sort of worked on Davy, and he says:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&rsquo;Vast there! He&rsquo;s nothing but a cub. I&rsquo;ll paint the man that tetches him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I looked around on them, and some of them grumbled and growled, and Bob put down the paint, and the others didn&rsquo;t take it up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come here to the fire, and less see what you&rsquo;re up to here,&rdquo; says Davy. &ldquo;Now set down there and give an account of yourself. How long have you been aboard here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not over a quarter of a minute, sir,&rdquo; says I.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How did you get dry so quick?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. I&rsquo;m always that way, mostly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, you are, are you? What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I warn&rsquo;t going to tell my name. I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so I just says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Charles William Allbright, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then they roared</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the whole crowd; and I was mighty glad I said that, because maybe laughing would get them in a better humor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When they got done laughing, Davy says:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hardly do, Charles William. You couldn&rsquo;t have growed this much in five year, and you was a baby when you come out of the bar&rsquo;l, you know, and dead at that.

What is your name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aleck Hopkins, sir.

She lays up the bend yonder. I was born on her. Pap has traded up and down here all his life; and he told me to swim off here, because when you went by he said he would like to get some of you to speak to a Mr. Jonas Turner, in Cairo, and tell him</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, sir, it&rsquo;s as true as the world; Pap he says </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, your grandmother!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They all laughed, and 1 tried again to talk, but they broke in on me and stopped me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, looky-here,&rdquo; says Davy; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re scared, and so you talk wild.

Looky-here; if we let you off this time, will you keep out of these kind of scrapes hereafter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed I will, boss. You try me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, then. You ain&rsquo;t but little ways from shore. Overboard with you, and don&rsquo;t you make a fool of yourself another time this way.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Blast it, boy, some raftsmen would rawhide you till you were black and blue!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t wait to kiss good-bye, but went overboard and broke for shore. When Jim come along by and by, the big raft was away out of sight around the point. I swum out and got aboard, and was mighty glad to see home again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I had to tell Jim I didn&rsquo;t find out how far it was to Cairo. He was pretty sorry. There warn&rsquo;t nothing to do, now, but to look out sharp for the town, and not pass it without seeing it. He said he&rsquo;d be mighty sure to see it, because he&rsquo;d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it he&rsquo;d be in the slave country again and no more show for freedom. Every little while he jumps up and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dah she is!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But it warn&rsquo;t. It was Jack-o-lanterns, or lightning-bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he was most free</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and who was to blame for it? Why, me. I couldn&rsquo;t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn&rsquo;t rest; I couldn&rsquo;t stay still in one place. It hadn&rsquo;t ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it staid with me and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to myself that I warn&rsquo;t to blame, because I didn&rsquo;t run Jim off from his rightful owner; but it warn&rsquo;t no use, conscience up and says, every time, &ldquo;But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody.&rdquo; That was so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t get around that, noway. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me, &ldquo;What had poor Miss Watson done to you, that you could see her slave go off right under your eyes and never say one single word? What did that poor old woman do to you, that you could treat her so mean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how. That&rsquo;s what she done.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still. Every time he danced around and says, &ldquo;Dah&rsquo;s Cairo!&rdquo; it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it was Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn&rsquo;t sell them, they&rsquo;d get an Ab&rsquo;litionist to go and steal them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn&rsquo;t ever dared to talk such talk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free. It was according to the old saying, &ldquo;give a slave an inch and he&rsquo;ll take an ell.&rdquo; Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking. Here was this slave which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">children that belonged to a man I didn&rsquo;t even know; a man that hadn&rsquo;t ever done me no harm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it, &ldquo;Let up on me</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it ain&rsquo;t too late, yet</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll paddle ashore at the first light, and tell.&rdquo; I felt easy, and happy, and light as a feather, right off. All my troubles was gone. I went to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself. By-and-by one showed. Jim sings out:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;s safe, Huck, we&rsquo;s safe! Jump up and crack yo&rsquo; heels, dat&rsquo;s de good ole Cairo at las&rsquo;, I jis knows it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the canoe and go see, Jim. It mightn&rsquo;t be, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pooty soon I&rsquo;ll be a-shout&rsquo;n for joy, en I&rsquo;ll say, it&rsquo;s all on accounts o&rsquo; Huck; I&rsquo;s a free man, en I couldn&rsquo;t ever ben free ef it hadn&rsquo; ben for Huck; Huck done it. Jim won&rsquo;t ever forgit you, Huck; you&rsquo;s de bes&rsquo; fren&rsquo; Jim&rsquo;s ever had; en you&rsquo;s de only fren&rsquo; ole Jim&rsquo;s got, now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along slow then, and I warn&rsquo;t right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I warn&rsquo;t. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on&rsquo;y white genlman dat ever kep&rsquo; his promise to ole Jim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, I just felt sick. But I says, I got to do it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I can&rsquo;t get out of it. Right then, along comes a skiff with two men in it, with guns, and they stopped and I stopped. One of them says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, yonder?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A piece of a raft,&rdquo; I says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you belong on it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Any men on it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Only one, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s five slaves run off to-night, up yonder above the head of the bend. Is your man white or black?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn&rsquo;t come. I tried, for a second or two, to brace up and out with it, but I warn&rsquo;t man enough</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">hadn&rsquo;t the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s white.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;ll go and see for ourselves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s pap that&rsquo;s there, and maybe you&rsquo;d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. He&rsquo;s sick</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and so is mam and Mary Ann.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, the devil! we&rsquo;re in a hurry, boy. But I s&rsquo;pose we&rsquo;ve got to. Come</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">buckle to your paddle, and let&rsquo;s get along.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. When we had made a stroke or two, I says</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pap&rsquo;ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can&rsquo;t do it by myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy, what&rsquo;s the matter with your father?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">a</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">well, it ain&rsquo;t anything, much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They stopped pulling. It warn&rsquo;t but a mighty little ways to the raft, now. One says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Boy, that&rsquo;s a lie. What is the matter with your pap? Answer up square, now, and it&rsquo;ll be the better for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will, sir, I will, honest</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but don&rsquo;t leave us, please. It&rsquo;s the</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">gentlemen, if you&rsquo;ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the head-line, you won&rsquo;t have to come a-near the raft</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">please do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Set her back, John, set her back!&rdquo; says one. They backed water. &ldquo;Keep away, boy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">keep to looard. Confound it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us. Your pap&rsquo;s got the small-pox, and you know it precious well. Why didn&rsquo;t you come out and say so? Do you want to spread it all over?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says I, a-blubbering, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told everybody before, and then they just went away and left us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Poor devil, there&rsquo;s something in that. We are right down sorry for you, but we</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">well, hang it, we don&rsquo;t want the small-pox, you see. Look here, I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do. Don&rsquo;t you try to land by yourself, or you&rsquo;ll smash everything to pieces. You float along down about twenty miles and you&rsquo;ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. It will be long after sun-up, then, and when you ask for help, you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever. Don&rsquo;t be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. Now we&rsquo;re trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that&rsquo;s a good boy. It wouldn&rsquo;t do any good to land yonder where the light is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it&rsquo;s only a wood-yard. Say</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I reckon your father&rsquo;s poor, and I&rsquo;m bound to say he&rsquo;s in pretty hard luck. Here</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll put a twenty dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave you, but my kingdom! it won&rsquo;t do to fool with small-pox, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on, Parker,&rdquo; says the other man, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a twenty to put on the board for me. Good-bye, boy, you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, my boy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">good-bye, good-bye. If you see any runaway slaves you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good-bye, sir,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let no runaway slaves get by me if I can help it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They went off, and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn&rsquo;t no use for me to try to learn to do right; a body that don&rsquo;t get started right when he&rsquo;s little, ain&rsquo;t got no show</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">when the pinch comes there ain&rsquo;t nothing to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat. Then I thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;d a done right and give Jim up; would you felt better than what you do now? No, says I, I&rsquo;d feel bad</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d feel just the same way I do now. Well, then, says I, what&rsquo;s the use you learning to do right, when it&rsquo;s troublesome to do right and ain&rsquo;t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same? I was stuck. I couldn&rsquo;t answer that. So I reckoned I wouldn&rsquo;t bother no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I went into the wigwam; Jim warn&rsquo;t there. I looked all around; he warn&rsquo;t anywhere. I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here I is, Huck. Is dey out o&rsquo; sight yit? Don&rsquo;t talk loud.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He was in the river, under the stern oar, with just his nose out. I told him they was out of sight, so he come aboard. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was a-listenin&rsquo; to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho&rsquo; if dey come aboard. Den I was gwyne to swim to de raf&rsquo; agin when dey was gone. But lawsy, how you did fool &rsquo;em, Huck! Dat wuz de smartes&rsquo; dodge! I tell you, chile, I &rsquo;speck it save&rsquo; ole Jim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">ole Jim ain&rsquo;t gwyne to forgit you for dat, honey.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise, twenty dollars apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States. He said twenty mile more warn&rsquo;t far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good. Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and getting all ready to quit rafting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I went off in the canoe, to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mister, is that town Cairo?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cairo? no. You must be a blame&rsquo; fool.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">What town is it, mister?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here botherin&rsquo; around me for about a half a minute longer, you&rsquo;ll get something you won&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it was high ground, so I didn&rsquo;t go. No high ground about Cairo, Jim said. I had forgot it. We laid up for the day, on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank. I begun to suspicion something. So did Jim. I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Doan&rsquo; less&rsquo; talk about it, Huck. Po&rsquo; slaves can&rsquo;t have no luck. I awluz &rsquo;spected dat rattle-snake skin warn&rsquo;t done wid its work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d never seen that snake-skin, Jim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I do wish I&rsquo;d never laid eyes on it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; fault, Huck; you didn&rsquo; know. Don&rsquo;t you blame yo&rsquo;self &rsquo;bout it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water in shore, sure enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy! So it was all up with Cairo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We talked it all over. It wouldn&rsquo;t do to take to the shore; we couldn&rsquo;t take the raft up the stream, of course. There warn&rsquo;t no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept all day amongst the cotton-wood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work, and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We didn&rsquo;t say a word for a good while. There warn&rsquo;t anything to say. We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattle-snake skin; so what was the use to talk about it? It would only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">By-and-by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn&rsquo;t no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in. We warn&rsquo;t going to borrow it when there warn&rsquo;t anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So we shoved out, after dark, on the raft.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Anybody that don&rsquo;t believe yet, that it&rsquo;s foolishness to handle a snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it now, if they read on and see what more it done for us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. But we didn&rsquo;t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and more. Well, the night got gray, and ruther thick, which is the next meanest thing to fog. You can&rsquo;t tell the shape of the river, and you can&rsquo;t see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she would see it. Up-stream boats didn&rsquo;t generly come close to us; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We could hear her pounding along, but we didn&rsquo;t see her good till she was close. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks he&rsquo;s mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to try to shave us; but she didn&rsquo;t seem to be sheering off a bit. She was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the engines, a pow-wow of cussing, and whistling of steam</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight through the raft.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I dived</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. I could always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I staid under water a minute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting. I popped out to my arm-pits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I could hear her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn&rsquo;t get any answer; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was &ldquo;treading water,&rdquo; and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good long time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clum up the bank. I couldn&rsquo;t see but a little ways, but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log house before I noticed it. I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.4cfpr2exgrjl"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 17</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In about half a minute somebody spoke out of a window, without putting his head out, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Be done, boys!

Now, all ready. Step forward, George Jackson. And mind, don&rsquo;t you hurry</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">come mighty slow. If there&rsquo;s anybody with you, let him keep back</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">if he shows himself he&rsquo;ll be shot. Come along, now.

I took one slow step at a time, and there warn&rsquo;t a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart. The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind me. When I got to the three log door-steps, I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting. I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more, till somebody said, &ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s enough</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">put your head in.&rdquo; I done it, but I judged they would take it off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and me at them, for about a quarter of a minute. Three big men with guns pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray and about sixty, the other two thirty or more</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">all of them fine and handsome</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two young women which I couldn&rsquo;t see right well. The old gentleman says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I reckon it&rsquo;s all right. Come in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As soon as I was in, the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor, and got together in a corner that was out of range of the front windows</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there warn&rsquo;t none on the side. They held the candle, and took a good look at me, and all said, &ldquo;Why he ain&rsquo;t a Shepherdson</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">no, there ain&rsquo;t any Shepherdson about him.&rdquo; Then the old man said he hoped I wouldn&rsquo;t mind being searched for arms, because he didn&rsquo;t mean no harm by it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it was only to make sure. So he didn&rsquo;t pry into my pockets, but only felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right. He told me to make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old lady says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why bless you, Saul, the poor thing&rsquo;s as wet as he can be; and don&rsquo;t you reckon it may be he&rsquo;s hungry?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;True for you, Rachel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I forgot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So the old lady says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Betsy&rdquo; (this was a slave woman), &ldquo;you fly around and get him something to eat, as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake up Buck and tell him</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Oh, here he is himself. Buck, take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that&rsquo;s dry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Buck looked about as old as me</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">thirteen or fourteen or along there, though he was a little bigger than me. He hadn&rsquo;t on anything but a shirt, and he was very frowsy-headed. He come in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they no Shepherdsons around?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They said, no, &rsquo;twas a false alarm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;if they&rsquo;d a ben some, I reckon I&rsquo;d a got one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They all laughed, and Bob says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you&rsquo;ve been so slow in coming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, nobody come after me, and it ain&rsquo;t right. I&rsquo;m always kep&rsquo; down; I don&rsquo;t get no show.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Never mind, Buck, my boy,&rdquo; says the old man, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have show enough, all in good time, don&rsquo;t you fret about that. Go &rsquo;long with you now, and do as your mother told you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When we got up stairs to his room, he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. While I was at it he asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him, he started to telling me about a blue jay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went out. I said I didn&rsquo;t know; I hadn&rsquo;t heard about it before, no way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, guess,&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How&rsquo;m I going to guess,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;when I never heard tell about it before?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But you can guess, can&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s just as easy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Which candle?&rdquo; I says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, any candle,&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where he was,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;where was he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why he was in the dark! That&rsquo;s where he was!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, blame it, it&rsquo;s a riddle, don&rsquo;t you see? Say, how long are you going to stay here? You got to stay always. We can just have booming times</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they don&rsquo;t have no school now. Do you own a dog? I&rsquo;ve got a dog</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and he&rsquo;ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in. Do you like to comb up, Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness? You bet I don&rsquo;t, but ma she makes me. Confound these ole britches, I reckon I&rsquo;d better put &rsquo;em on, but I&rsquo;d ruther not, it&rsquo;s so warm. Are you all ready? All right</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">come along, old hoss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and butter-milk</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that is what they had for me down there, and there ain&rsquo;t nothing better that ever I&rsquo;ve come across yet. Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes. except the slave woman, which was gone, and the two young women. They all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. The young women had quilts around them, and their hair down their backs. They all asked me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went to hunt them and he warn&rsquo;t heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died, and then there warn&rsquo;t nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died I took what there was left, because the farm didn&rsquo;t belong to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be here. So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it. Then it was most daylight, and everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked in the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to think, and when Buck waked up, I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can you spell, Buck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I bet you can&rsquo;t spell my name,&rdquo; says I.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I bet you what you dare I can,&rdquo; says he.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;go ahead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;G-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there now,&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you done it, but I didn&rsquo;t think you could. It ain&rsquo;t no slouch of a name to spell</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">right off without studying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I set it down, private, because somebody might want me to spell it, next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. I hadn&rsquo;t seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style. It didn&rsquo;t have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in a town. There warn&rsquo;t no bed in the parlor, not a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they washed them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantel-piece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the pendulum swing behind it. It was beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out. They wouldn&rsquo;t took any money for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn&rsquo;t open their mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things. On a table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn&rsquo;t real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk or whatever it was, underneath.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This table had a cover made out of beautiful oil-cloth, with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a big family Bible, full of pictures. One was &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; about a man that left his family it didn&rsquo;t say why. I read considerable in it now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was &ldquo;Friendship&rsquo;s Offering,&rdquo; full of beautiful stuff and poetry but I didn&rsquo;t read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay&rsquo;s Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn&rsquo;s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead. There was a Hymn Book, and a lot of other books. And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They had pictures hung on the walls</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called &ldquo;Signing the Declaration.&rdquo; There was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see before; blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the arm-pits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said &ldquo;Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.&rdquo; Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said &ldquo;I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.&rdquo; There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing-wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said &ldquo;And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.&rdquo; These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn&rsquo;t somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little, they always give me the fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned, that with her disposition, she was having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and the idea was, to see which pair would look best and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head. It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drowned:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC&rsquo;D.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And did young Stephen sicken,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And did young Stephen die?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And did the sad hearts thicken,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And did the mourners cry?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">No; such was not the fate of</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Young Stephen Dowling Bots;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Though sad hearts round him thickened,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&rsquo;Twas not from sickness&rsquo; shots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">No whooping-cough did rack his frame,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nor measles drear, with spots;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Not these impaired the sacred name</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of Stephen Dowling Bots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Despised love struck not with woe</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That head of curly knots,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nor stomach troubles laid him low,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Young Stephen Dowling Bots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">O no.

Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn&rsquo;t ever have to stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn&rsquo;t find anything to rhyme with it she would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead. She warn&rsquo;t particular, she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about, just so it was sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her &ldquo;tribute&rdquo; before he was cold. She called them tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person&rsquo;s name, which was Whistler. She warn&rsquo;t ever the same, after that; she never complained, but she kind of pined away and did not live long. Poor thing, many&rsquo;s the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrapbook and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little. I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn&rsquo;t going to let anything come between us. Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it didn&rsquo;t seem right that there warn&rsquo;t nobody to make some about her, now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn&rsquo;t seem to make it go, somehow. They kept Emmeline&rsquo;s room trim and nice and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there. The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of slaves, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there, mostly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on the windows: white, with pictures painted on them, of castles with vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink. There was a little old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing, &ldquo;The Last Link is Broken&rdquo; and play &ldquo;The Battle of Prague&rdquo; on it. The walls of all the rooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day, and it was a cool, comfortable place. Nothing couldn&rsquo;t be better. And warn&rsquo;t the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.vzgl78pfdqx7"><span class="c48 c50"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 18</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all over; and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and that&rsquo;s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn&rsquo;t no more quality than a mudcat, himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean-shaved every morning, all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight, and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn&rsquo;t no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn&rsquo;t ever loud. He was as kind as he could be</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn&rsquo;t ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">everybody was always good mannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned into a cloud-bank it was awful dark for a half a minute and that was enough; there wouldn&rsquo;t nothing go wrong again for a week.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When him and the old lady come down in the morning, all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn&rsquo;t set down again till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanters was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom&rsquo;s and Bob&rsquo;s was mixed, and then they bowed and said &ldquo;Our duty to you, sir, and madam;&rdquo; and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Bob was the oldest, and Tom next. Tall, beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wore broad Panama hats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then there was Miss Charlotte, she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and grand, but as good as she could be, when she warn&rsquo;t stirred up; but when she was, she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her father. She was beautiful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was gentle and sweet, like a dove, and she was only twenty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Each person had their own slave to wait on them</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Buck, too. My slave had a monstrous easy time, because I warn&rsquo;t used to having anybody do anything for me, but Buck&rsquo;s was on the jump most of the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This was all there was of the family, now; but there used to be more</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The old gentleman owned a lot of farms, and over a hundred slaves. Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods, daytimes, and balls at the house, nights. These people was mostly kin-folks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a handsome lot of quality, I tell you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was another clan of aristocracy around there</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">five or six families</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as high-toned, and well born, and rich and grand, as the tribe of Grangerfords. The Shepherdsons and the Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there, on their fine horses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">One day Buck and me was away out in the woods, hunting, and heard a horse coming. We was crossing the road. Buck says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quick! Jump for the woods!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier. He had his gun across his pommel. I had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck&rsquo;s gun go off at my ear, and Harney&rsquo;s hat tumbled off from his head. He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid. But we didn&rsquo;t wait. We started through the woods on a run. The woods warn&rsquo;t thick, so I looked over my shoulder, to dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away the way he come</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn&rsquo;t see. We never stopped running till we got home. The old gentleman&rsquo;s eyes blazed a minute</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rsquo;twas pleasure, mainly, I judged</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">then his face sort of smoothed down, and he says, kind of gentle:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that shooting from behind a bush. Why didn&rsquo;t you step into the road, my boy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Shepherdsons don&rsquo;t, father. They always take advantage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. The two young men looked dark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia she turned pale, but the color come back when she found the man warn&rsquo;t hurt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by ourselves, I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you want to kill him, Buck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I bet I did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did he do to you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Him? He never done nothing to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why nothing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">only it&rsquo;s on account of the feud.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a feud?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, where was you raised? Don&rsquo;t you know what a feud is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Never heard of it before</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">tell me about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says Buck, &ldquo;a feud is this way. A man has a quarrel with another man, and kills him; then that other man&rsquo;s brother kills him; then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the cousins chip in</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and by-and-by everybody&rsquo;s killed off, and there ain&rsquo;t no more feud. But it&rsquo;s kind of slow, and takes a long time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Has this one been going on long, Buck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well I should reckon! it started thirty year ago, or som&rsquo;ers along there. There was trouble &rsquo;bout something and then a lawsuit to settle it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the man that won the suit</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which he would naturally do, of course. Anybody would.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What was the trouble about, Buck?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">land?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I reckon maybe</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, who done the shooting? </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Laws, how do I know? it was so long ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t anybody know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old folks; but they don&rsquo;t know, now, what the row was about in the first place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Has there been many killed, Buck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">right smart chance of funerals. But they don&rsquo;t always kill. Pa&rsquo;s got a few buck-shot in him; but he don&rsquo;t mind it &rsquo;cuz he don&rsquo;t weigh much anyway. Bob&rsquo;s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom&rsquo;s been hurt once or twice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, we got one and they got one. &rsquo;Bout three months ago, my cousin Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods, on t&rsquo;other side of the river, and didn&rsquo;t have no weapon with him, which was blame&rsquo; foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin&rsquo; after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and &rsquo;stead of jumping off and taking to the brush, Bud &rsquo;lowed he could outrun him; so they had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all the time; so at last Bud seen it warn&rsquo;t any use, so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old man he rode up and shot him down. But he didn&rsquo;t git much chance to enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid him out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I reckon he warn&rsquo;t a coward. Not by a blame&rsquo; sight. There ain&rsquo;t a coward amongst them Shepherdsons</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">not a one. And there ain&rsquo;t no cowards amongst the Grangerfords, either. Why, that old man kep&rsquo; up his end in a fight one day, for a half an hour, against three Grangerfords, and come out winner. They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little wood-pile, and kep&rsquo; his horse before him to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords staid on their horses and capered around the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them. Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the Grangerfords had to be fetched home</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and one of &rsquo;em was dead, and another died the next day. No, sir, if a body&rsquo;s out hunting for cowards, he don&rsquo;t want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz they don&rsquo;t breed any of that kind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall. The Shepherdsons done the same. It was pretty ornery preaching</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">all about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a powerful lot to say about faith, and good works, and free grace, and preforeordestination, and I don&rsquo;t know what all, that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun, sound asleep. I went up to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell anybody, and I said I would. Then she said she&rsquo;d forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church, between two other books and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say nothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the road, and there warn&rsquo;t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two, for there warn&rsquo;t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it&rsquo;s cool. If you notice, most folks don&rsquo;t go to church only when they&rsquo;ve got to; but a hog is different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Says I to myself something&rsquo;s up</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it ain&rsquo;t natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament; so I give it a shake, and out drops a little piece of paper with &ldquo;Half-past two &rdquo; wrote on it with a pencil. I ransacked it, but couldn&rsquo;t find anything else. I couldn&rsquo;t make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs, there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think, she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She was mighty red in the face, for a minute, and her eyes lighted up and it made her powerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing, and I told her &ldquo;no, only coarse-hand,&rdquo; and then she said the paper warn&rsquo;t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon I noticed that my slave was following along behind. When we was out of sight of the house, he looked back and around a second, and then comes a-running, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mars Jawge, if you&rsquo;ll come down into de swamp, I&rsquo;ll show you a whole stack o&rsquo; water-moccasins.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Thinks I, that&rsquo;s mighty curious; he said that yesterday. He oughter know a body don&rsquo;t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for them. What is he up to anyway? So I says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, trot ahead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I followed a half a mile, then he struck out over the swamp and waded ankle deep as much as another half mile. We come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines, and he says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You shove right in dah, jist a few steps, Mars Jawge, dah&rsquo;s whah dey is. I&rsquo;s seed &rsquo;m befo&rsquo;, I don&rsquo;t k&rsquo;yer to see &rsquo;em no mo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid him. I poked into the place a-ways, and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom, all hung around with vines, and found a man laying there asleep</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and by jings it was my old Jim!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again, but it warn&rsquo;t. He nearly cried, he was so glad, but he warn&rsquo;t surprised. Said he swum along behind me, that night, and heard me yell every time, but dasn&rsquo;t answer, because he didn&rsquo;t want nobody to pick him up, and take him into slavery again. Says he</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I got hurt a little, en couldn&rsquo;t swim fas&rsquo;, so I wuz a considable ways behine you, towards de las&rsquo;; when you landed I reck&rsquo;ned I could ketch up wid you on de lan&rsquo; &rsquo;dout havin&rsquo; to shout at you, but when I see dat house I begin to go slow.

Dat Jack&rsquo;s a good slave, en pooty smart.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, he is. He ain&rsquo;t ever told me you was here; told me to come, and he&rsquo;d show me a lot of water-moccasins. If anything happens, he ain&rsquo;t mixed up in it. He can say he never seen us together, and it&rsquo;ll be the truth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t want to talk much about the next day. I reckon I&rsquo;ll cut it pretty short. I waked up about dawn, and was agoing to turn over and go to sleep again, when I noticed how still it was</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">didn&rsquo;t seem to be anybody stirring. That warn&rsquo;t usual. Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">nobody around; everything as still as a mouse. Just the same outside; thinks I, what does it mean? Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Says he:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, Mars Jawge?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, den, Miss Sophia&rsquo;s run off! &rsquo;deed she has. She run off in de night, sometime</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">nobody don&rsquo;t know jis&rsquo; when</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">run off to git married to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">leastways, so dey &rsquo;spec. De fambly foun&rsquo; it out, &rsquo;bout half an hour ago</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">maybe a little mo&rsquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">en&rsquo; I tell you dey warn&rsquo;t no time los&rsquo;. Sich another hurryin&rsquo; up guns en hosses you never see! De women folks has gone for to stir up de relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him &rsquo;fo&rsquo; he kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. I reck&rsquo;n dey&rsquo;s gwyne to be mighty rough times.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Buck went off &rsquo;thout waking me up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well I reck&rsquo;n he did! Dey warn&rsquo;t gwyne to mix you up in it. Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en &rsquo;lowed he&rsquo;s gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey&rsquo;ll be plenty un &rsquo;m dah, I reck&rsquo;n, en you bet you he&rsquo;ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I took up the river road as hard as I could put. By-and-by I begin to hear guns a good ways off. When I come in sight of the log store and the wood-pile where the steamboats lands, I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks of a cotton-wood that was out of reach, and watched. There was a wood-rank four foot high, a little ways in front of the tree, and first I was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but they couldn&rsquo;t come it. Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the wood-pile he got shot at. The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch both ways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">By-and-by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the run. They got half-way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them. They gained on the boys, but it didn&rsquo;t do no good, the boys had too good a start; they got to the wood-pile that was in front of my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they was out of sight, I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn&rsquo;t know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree, at first. He was awful surprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or other</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">wouldn&rsquo;t be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I dasn&rsquo;t come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and &rsquo;lowed that him and his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this day, yet. He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two or three of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them, in ambush. Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the Shepherdsons was too strong for them. I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they&rsquo;d got across the river and was safe. I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he didn&rsquo;t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I hain&rsquo;t ever heard anything like it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses! The boys jumped for the river</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">both of them hurt</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, &ldquo;Kill them, kill them!&rdquo; It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree. I ain&rsquo;t agoing to tell all that happened</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it would make me sick again if I was to do that. I wished I hadn&rsquo;t ever come ashore that night, to see such things. I ain&rsquo;t ever going to get shut of them</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">lots of times I dream about them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I staid in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down. Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the trouble was still agoing on. I was mighty down-hearted; so I made up my mind I wouldn&rsquo;t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up and this awful mess wouldn&rsquo;t ever happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I got down out of the tree, I crept along down the river bank a piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering up Buck&rsquo;s face, for he was mighty good to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was just dark, now. I never went near the house, but struck through the woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn&rsquo;t on his island, so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the raft was gone! My souls, but I was scared! I couldn&rsquo;t get my breath for most a minute. Then I raised a yell. A voice not twenty-five foot from me, says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good lan&rsquo;! is dat you, honey? Doan&rsquo; make no noise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was Jim&rsquo;s voice</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">nothing ever sounded so good before. I run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was so glad to see me. He says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Laws bless you, chile, I &rsquo;uz right down sho&rsquo; you&rsquo;s dead agin. Jack&rsquo;s been heah, he say he reck&rsquo;n you&rsquo;s ben shot, kase you didn&rsquo; come home no mo&rsquo;; so I&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; dis minute a startin&rsquo; de raf&rsquo; down towards de mouf er de crick, so&rsquo;s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for certain you is dead. Lawsy, I&rsquo;s mighty glad to git you back agin, honey.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s mighty good; they won&rsquo;t find me, and they&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;ve been killed, and floated down the river</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there&rsquo;s something up there that&rsquo;ll help them to think so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">so don&rsquo;t you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and judged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn&rsquo;t had a bite to eat since yesterday; so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage, and greens</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there ain&rsquo;t nothing in the world so good, when it&rsquo;s cooked right</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and whilst I eat my supper we talked, and had a good time. I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was Jim to get away from the swamp. We said there warn&rsquo;t no home like a raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don&rsquo;t. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.7xekt6lfe8hi"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 19</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Two or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by, they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here is the way we put in the time. It was a monstrous big river down there</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">sometimes a mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid day-times; soon as night was most gone, we stopped navigating and tied up</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">nearly always in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows and hid the raft with them. Then we set out the lines. Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound, anywheres</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">perfectly still</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bull-frogs a-cluttering, maybe. The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that was the woods on t&rsquo;other side</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you couldn&rsquo;t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness, then the river softened up, away off, and warn&rsquo;t black anymore, but gray; you could see little dark spots drifting along, ever so far away</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">trading scows, and such things; and long black streaks</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by-and-by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there&rsquo;s a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t&rsquo;other side of the river, being a wood-yard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh, and sweet to smell, on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way, because they&rsquo;ve left dead fish laying around, gars, and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you&rsquo;ve got the full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A little smoke couldn&rsquo;t be noticed, now, so we would take some fish off of the lines, and cook up a hot breakfast. And afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by-and-by lazy off to sleep. Wake up, by-and-by, and look to see what done it, and maybe see a steamboat, coughing along up stream, so far off towards the other side you couldn&rsquo;t tell nothing about her only whether she was stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn&rsquo;t be nothing to hear nor nothing to see</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">just solid lonesomeness. Next you&rsquo;d see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they&rsquo;re most always doing it on a raft; you&rsquo;d see the axe flash, and come down</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you don&rsquo;t hear nothing; you see that axe go up again, and by the time it&rsquo;s above the man&rsquo;s head, then you hear the k&rsquo;chunk! </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it had took all that time to come over the water. So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness. Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn&rsquo;t run over them. A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">heard them plain; but we couldn&rsquo;t see no sign of them; it made you feel crawly, it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air. Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, spirits wouldn&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;dern the dern fog.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Soon as it was night, out we shoved; when we got her out to about the middle, we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water and talked about all kinds of things</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">we was always naked, day and night, whenever the mosquitoes would let us</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the new clothes Buck&rsquo;s folks made for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn&rsquo;t go much on clothes, no-how.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sometimes we&rsquo;d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe a spark</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which was a candle in a cabin window</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts. It&rsquo;s lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky, up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made, or only just happened</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would have took too long to make so many. Jim said the moon could a laid them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn&rsquo;t say nothing against it, because I&rsquo;ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they&rsquo;d got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her pow-wow shut off and leave the river still again; and by-and-by her waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn&rsquo;t hear nothing for you couldn&rsquo;t tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or three hours the shores was black</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">no more sparks in the cabin windows. These sparks was our clock</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the first one that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up, right away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">One morning about day-break, I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it was only two hundred yards</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn&rsquo;t get some berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cow-path crossed the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it. I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was after anybody I judged it was me</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or maybe Jim. I was about to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung out and begged me to save their lives</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">said they hadn&rsquo;t been doing nothing, and was being chased for it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">said there was men and dogs a-coming. They wanted to jump right in, but I says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it. I don&rsquo;t hear the dogs and horses yet; you&rsquo;ve got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;ll throw the dogs off the scent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead, and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off, shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn&rsquo;t see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got further and further away all the time, we couldn&rsquo;t hardly hear them at all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cotton-woods and was safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">One of these fellows was about seventy, or upwards, and had a bald head and very gray whiskers. He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a greasy blue woolen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot tops, and home-knit galluses</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">no, he only had one. He had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons, flung over his arm, and both of them had big fat ratty-looking carpet-bags.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The other fellow was about thirty and dressed about as ornery. After breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out was that these chaps didn&rsquo;t know one another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What got you into trouble?&rdquo; says the baldhead to t&rsquo;other chap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but I staid about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the act of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and you told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off. So I told you I was expecting trouble myself and would scatter out with you. That&rsquo;s the whole yarn</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what&rsquo;s yourn?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d ben a-runnin&rsquo; a little temperance revival thar, &rsquo;bout a week, and was the pet of the women-folks, big and little, for I was makin&rsquo; it mighty warm for the rummies, I tell you, and takin&rsquo; as much as five or six dollars a night</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">ten cents a head, children and slaves free</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and business a growin&rsquo; all the time; when somehow or another a little report got around, last night, that I had a way of puttin&rsquo; in my time with a private jug, on the sly. A slave rousted me out this mornin&rsquo;, and told me the people was getherin&rsquo; on the quiet, with their dogs and horses, and they&rsquo;d be along pretty soon and give me &rsquo;bout half an hour&rsquo;s start, and then run me down, if they could; and if they got me they&rsquo;d tar and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure. I didn&rsquo;t wait for no breakfast</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I warn&rsquo;t hungry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Old man,&rdquo; says the young one, &ldquo;I reckon we might double-team it together; what do you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t undisposed.

Preachin&rsquo;s my line, too; and workin&rsquo; camp-meetin&rsquo;s; and missionaryin around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh and says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you alassin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; says the baldhead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded down into such company.&rdquo; And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dern your skin, ain&rsquo;t the company good enough for you?&rdquo; says the baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, it is good enough for me; it&rsquo;s as good as I deserve; for who fetched me so low, when I was so high? I did myself. I don&rsquo;t blame you, gentlemen</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">far from it; I don&rsquo;t blame anybody. I deserve it all. Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there&rsquo;s a grave somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it&rsquo;s always done, and take everything from me</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">loved ones, property, everything</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but it can&rsquo;t take that. Some day I&rsquo;ll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken heart will be at rest.&rdquo; He went on a-wiping.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Drot your pore broken heart,&rdquo; says the baldhead; &ldquo;what are you heaving your pore broken heart at us f&rsquo;r? We hain&rsquo;t done nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I know you haven&rsquo;t. I ain&rsquo;t blaming you, gentlemen. I brought myself down</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">yes, I did it myself. It&rsquo;s right I should suffer</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">perfectly right</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t make any moan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Brought you down from whar?

The secret of my birth</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The secret of your birth?

By rights I am a duke!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim&rsquo;s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too. Then the baldhead says: &ldquo;No! you can&rsquo;t mean it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father dying about the same time. The second son of the late duke seized the title and estates</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the infant real duke was ignored. I am the lineal descendant of that infant</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but he said it warn&rsquo;t much use, he couldn&rsquo;t be much comforted; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. He said we ought to bow, when we spoke to him, and say &ldquo;Your Grace,&rdquo; or &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your Lordship&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and he wouldn&rsquo;t mind it if we called him plain &ldquo;Bridgewater,&rdquo; which he said was a title, anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for him he wanted done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him, and says, &ldquo;Will yo Grace have some o&rsquo; dis, or some o&rsquo; dat?&rdquo; and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But the old man got pretty silent, by-and-by</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">didn&rsquo;t have much to say, and didn&rsquo;t look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke. He seemed to have something on his mind. So, along in the afternoon, he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looky here, Bilgewater,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nation sorry for you, but you ain&rsquo;t the only person that&rsquo;s had troubles like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, you ain&rsquo;t. You ain&rsquo;t the only person that&rsquo;s ben snaked down wrongfully out&rsquo;n a high place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, you ain&rsquo;t the only person that&rsquo;s had a secret of his birth.&rdquo; And by jings, he begins to cry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold! What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bilgewater, kin I trust you?&rdquo; says the old man, still sort of sobbing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To the bitter death!&rdquo; He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it, and says, &ldquo;The secret of your being: speak!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">You bet you Jim and me stared, this time. Then the duke says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, my friend, it is too true</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">your eyes is lookin&rsquo; at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You! At your age! No! You mean you&rsquo;re the late Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin&rsquo;, exiled, trampled-on and sufferin&rsquo; rightful King of France.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, he cried and took on so, that me and Jim didn&rsquo;t know hardly what to do, we was so sorry</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and so glad and proud we&rsquo;d got him with us, too. So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort him. But he said it warn&rsquo;t no use, nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him &ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; and waited on him first at meals, and didn&rsquo;t set down in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him, and doing this and that and t&rsquo;other for him, and standing up till he told us we might set down. This done him heaps of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable. But the duke kind of soured on him, and didn&rsquo;t look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still, the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke&rsquo;s great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father and was allowed to come to the palace considerable; but the duke staid huffy a good while, till by-and-by the king says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time, on this h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; your bein sour? It&rsquo;ll only make things uncomfortable. It ain&rsquo;t my fault I warn&rsquo;t born a duke, it ain&rsquo;t your fault you warn&rsquo;t born a king</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">so what&rsquo;s the use to worry? Make the best o&rsquo; things the way you find &rsquo;em, says I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s my motto. This ain&rsquo;t no bad thing that we&rsquo;ve struck here</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">plenty grub and an easy life</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">come, give us your hand, Duke, and less all be friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. It took away all the uncomfortableness, and we felt mighty good over it, because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It didn&rsquo;t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn&rsquo;t no kings nor dukes, at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds. But I never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it&rsquo;s the best way; then you don&rsquo;t have no quarrels, and don&rsquo;t get into no trouble. If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn&rsquo;t no objections, &rsquo;long as it would keep peace in the family; and it warn&rsquo;t no use to tell Jim, so I didn&rsquo;t tell him. If I never learnt nothing else out of pap I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.5h4fnm6fsh4x"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 20</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the day-time instead of running</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">was Jim a runaway slave? Says I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;Goodness sakes, would a runaway slave run south ?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">No, they allowed he wouldn&rsquo;t. I had to account for things some way, so I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike. Pa, he &rsquo;lowed he&rsquo;d break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who&rsquo;s got a little one- horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans. Pa was pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he&rsquo;d squared up there warn&rsquo;t nothing left but sixteen dollars and our slave, Jim. That warn&rsquo;t enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way. Well, when the river rose, pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we&rsquo;d go down to Orleans on it. Pa&rsquo;s luck didn&rsquo;t hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft, one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim and me come up, all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four years old, so they never come up no more. Well, for the next day or two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was a runaway slave. We don&rsquo;t run day-times no more, now; nights they don&rsquo;t bother us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the day-time if we want to. I&rsquo;ll think the thing over</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll invent a plan that&rsquo;ll fix it. We&rsquo;ll let it alone for today, because of course we don&rsquo;t want to go by that town yonder in daylight</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it mightn&rsquo;t be healthy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat lightning was squirting around, low down in the sky, and the leaves was beginning to shiver</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see that. So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see what the beds was like. My bed was a straw tick</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">better than Jim&rsquo;s, which was a corn-shuck tick; there&rsquo;s always cobs around about in a shuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over, the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it makes such a rustling that you wake up. Well, the duke allowed he would take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn&rsquo;t. He says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a corn-shuck bed warn&rsquo;t just fitten for me to sleep on. Your Grace&rsquo;ll take the shuck bed yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim and me was in a sweat again, for a minute, being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when the duke says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression. Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I submit; &rsquo;tis my fate. I am alone in the world</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">let me suffer; I can bear it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town. We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by-and-by</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that was the town, you know</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and slid by, about a half a mile out, all right. When we was three-quarters of a mile below, we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o&rsquo;clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. It was my watch below, till twelve, but I wouldn&rsquo;t a turned in, anyway, if I&rsquo;d had a bed; because a body don&rsquo;t see such a storm as that every day in the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every second or two there&rsquo;d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you&rsquo;d see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a h-wack!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;bum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and then rip comes another flash and another sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft, sometimes, but I hadn&rsquo;t any clothes on, and didn&rsquo;t mind. We didn&rsquo;t have no trouble about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time, so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always mighty good, that way, Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam, but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn&rsquo;t no show for me; so I laid outside</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t mind the rain, because it was warm, and the waves warn&rsquo;t running so high, now. About two they come up again, though, and Jim was going to call me, but he changed his mind because he reckoned they warn&rsquo;t high enough yet to do any harm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper, and washed me overboard. It most killed Jim a-laughing. He was the easiest slave to laugh that ever was, anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by-and-by the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed, I rousted him out and we slid the raft into hiding-quarters for the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The king got out an old ratty deck of cards, after breakfast, and him and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game. Then they got tired of it, and allowed they would &ldquo;lay out a campaign,&rdquo; as they called it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag and fetched up a lot of little printed bills, and read them out loud. One bill said &ldquo;The celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban of Paris,&rdquo; would &ldquo;lecture on the Science of Phrenology&rdquo; at such and such a place, on the blank day of blank, at ten cents admission, and &ldquo;furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece.&rdquo; The duke said that was him. In another bill he was the &ldquo;world renowned Shaksperean tragedian, Garrick the Younger, of Drury Lane, London.&rdquo; In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with a &ldquo;divining rod,&rdquo; &ldquo;dissipating witch-spells,&rdquo; and so on. By-and-by he says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But the histrionic muse is the darling. Have you ever trod the boards, Royalty?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says the king.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You shall, then, before you&rsquo;re three days older, Fallen Grandeur,&rdquo; says the duke. &ldquo;The first good town we come to, we&rsquo;ll hire a hall and do the sword-fight in Richard III and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet. How does that strike you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater, but you see I don&rsquo;t know nothing about play-actn&rsquo;, and hain&rsquo;t ever seen much of it. I was too small when pap used to have &rsquo;em at the palace. Do you reckon you can learn me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Easy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;m jist a-freezn&rsquo; for something fresh, anyway. Less commence, right away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was, and who Juliet was, and said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But if Juliet&rsquo;s such a young gal, Duke, my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin&rsquo; to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t; you worry</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">these country jakes won&rsquo;t ever think of that. Besides, you know, you&rsquo;ll be in costume, and that makes all the difference in the world; Juliet&rsquo;s in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed, and she&rsquo;s got on her night-gown and her ruffled night-cap. Here are the costumes for the parts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was meedyevil armor for Richard III and t&rsquo;other chap, and a long white cotton night-shirt and a ruffled night-cap to match. The king was satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing. The king allowed he would go too, and see if he couldn&rsquo;t strike something. We was out of coffee, so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When we got there, there warn&rsquo;t nobody stirring; streets empty, and perfectly dead and still, like Sunday. We found a sick slave sunning himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn&rsquo;t too young or too sick or too old, was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the woods. The king got the directions, and allowed he&rsquo;d go and work that camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke said what he was after was a printing office. We found it; a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked. It was a dirty, littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway slaves on them, all over the walls. The duke shed his coat and said he was all right, now. So me and the king lit out for the camp-meeting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We got there in about a half an hour, fairly dripping, for it was a most awful hot day. There was as much as a thousand people there, from twenty mile around. The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched everywheres, feeding out of the wagon troughs and stomping to keep off the flies. There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was bigger and held crowds of people. The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs. They didn&rsquo;t have no backs. The preachers had high platforms to stand on, at one end of the sheds. The women had on sun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the young ones had on calico. Some of the young men was barefooted, and some of the children didn&rsquo;t have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks was courting on the sly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The first shed we come to, the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it, there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then he lined out two more for them to sing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and so on. The people woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end, some begun to groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacher begun to preach; and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other, and then a leaning down over the front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and that, shouting, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the brazen serpent in the wilderness! Look upon it and live!&rdquo; And people would shout out, &ldquo;Glory!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">A-a-men! &rdquo; And so he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, come to the mourners&rsquo; bench! come, black with sin! (amen!) come, sick and sore! (amen!) come, lame and halt, and blind! (amen!) come, pore and needy, sunk in shame! (a-a-men!) come all that&rsquo;s worn, and soiled, and suffering!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse is free, the door of heaven stands open</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">oh, enter in and be at rest!&rdquo; (a-a-men! glory, glory hallelujah! )</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And so on. You couldn&rsquo;t make out what the preacher said, any more, on account of the shouting and crying. Folks got up, everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way, just by main strength, to the mourners&rsquo; bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung, and shouted, and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, the first I knowed, the king got agoing; and you could hear him over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He told them he was a pirate</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">been a pirate for thirty years, out in the Indian Ocean, and his crew was thinned out considerable, last spring, in a fight, and he was home now, to take out some fresh men, and thanks to goodness he&rsquo;d been robbed last night, and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent, and he was glad of it, it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for the first time in his life; and poor as he was, he was going to start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all the pirate crews in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there, without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you thank me, don&rsquo;t you give me no credit, it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and that dear preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. Then somebody sings out, &ldquo;Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!&rdquo; Well, a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, &ldquo;Let him pass the hat around!&rdquo; Then everybody said it, the preacher too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So the king went all through the crowd with his hat, swabbing his eyes, and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would up and ask him would he let them kiss him, for to remember him by; and he always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses, and said they&rsquo;d think it was an honor; but he said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn&rsquo;t do no good, and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When we got back to the raft and he come to count up, he found he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a wagon when we was starting home through the woods. The king said, take it all around, it laid over any day he&rsquo;d ever put in in the missionarying line. He said it warn&rsquo;t no use talking, heathens don&rsquo;t amount to shucks, alongside of pirates, to work a camp-meeting with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke was thinking he&rsquo;d been doing pretty well, till the king come to show up, but after that he didn&rsquo;t think so so much. He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers, in that printing office</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">horse bills</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and took the money, four dollars. And he had got in ten dollars worth of advertisements for the paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cord-wood and onions, as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of his own head</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">three verses</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">kind of sweet and saddish</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the name of it was, &ldquo;Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper and didn&rsquo;t charge nothing for it. Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he&rsquo;d done a pretty square day&rsquo;s work for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he showed us another little job he&rsquo;d printed and hadn&rsquo;t charged for, because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway slave, with a bundle on a stick, over his shoulder, and &ldquo;$200 reward&rdquo; under it. The reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot. It said he run away from St. Jacques&rsquo; plantation, forty mile below New Orleans, last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send him back, he could have the reward and expenses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says the duke, &ldquo;after tonight we can run in the daytime if we want to. Whenever we see anybody coming, we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward. Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim, but it wouldn&rsquo;t go well with the story of us being so poor. Too much like jewelry. Ropes are the correct thing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">we must preserve the unities, as we say on the boards.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn&rsquo;t be no trouble about running daytimes. We judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the pow-wow we reckoned the duke&rsquo;s work in the printing office was going to make in that little town</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">then we could boom right along, if we wanted to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten o&rsquo;clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn&rsquo;t hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huck, does you reck&rsquo;n we gwyne to run acrost any mo&rsquo; kings on dis trip?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I reckon not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;dat&rsquo;s all right, den. I doan&rsquo; mine one er two kings, but dat&rsquo;s enough. Dis one&rsquo;s powerful drunk, en de duke ain&rsquo; much better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear what it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and had so much trouble, he&rsquo;d forgot it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.rsng931b8j3x"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 21</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was after sun-up, now, but we went right on, and didn&rsquo;t tie up. The king and the duke turned out, by-and-by, looking pretty rusty; but after they&rsquo;d jumped overboard and took a swim, it chippered them up a good deal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on a corner of the raft, and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart. When he had got it pretty good, him and the duke begun to practice it together. The duke had to learn him over and over again, how to say every speech; and he made him sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after while he said he done it pretty well; &ldquo;only,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t bellow out Romeo! that way, like a bull</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you must say it soft, and sick, and languishy, so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">R</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">o</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">o</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">meo! that is the idea; for Juliet&rsquo;s a dear sweet mere child of a girl, you know, and she don&rsquo;t bray like a jackass.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths, and begun to practice the sword-fight</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the duke called himself Richard III; and the way they laid on, and pranced around the raft was grand to see. But by-and-by the king tripped and fell overboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they&rsquo;d had in other times along the river.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After dinner, the duke says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, Capet, we&rsquo;ll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so I guess we&rsquo;ll add a little more to it. We want a little something to answer encores with, anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s onkores, Bilgewater?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke told him, and then says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor&rsquo;s hornpipe; and you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">well, let me see</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">oh, I&rsquo;ve got it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you can do Hamlet&rsquo;s soliloquy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hamlet&rsquo;s which?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hamlet&rsquo;s soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare. Ah, it&rsquo;s sublime, sublime! Always fetches the house. I haven&rsquo;t got it in the book</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ve only got one volume</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but I reckon I can piece it out from memory. I&rsquo;ll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call it back from recollection&rsquo;s vaults.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible every now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next he would sigh, and next he&rsquo;d let on to drop a tear. It was beautiful to see him. By-and-by he got it. He told us to give attention. Then he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that, all through his speech he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before. This is the speech</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it to the king</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That makes calamity of so long life;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But that the fear of something after death</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Murders the innocent sleep,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Great nature&rsquo;s second course,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Than fly to others that we know not of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s the respect must give us pause:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Wake Duncan with thy knocking!

It seemed like he was just born for it; and when he had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; and after that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a most uncommon lively place, for there warn&rsquo;t nothing but sword-fighting and rehearsing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">as the duke called it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">going on all the time. One morning, when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come in sight of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that afternoon, and the country people was already beginning to come in, in all kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave before night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he hired the court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills.

The stores and houses was most all old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn&rsquo;t ever been painted; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little gardens around them, but they didn&rsquo;t seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that didn&rsquo;t generly have but one hinge</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">a leather one. Some of the fences had been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in Clumbus&rsquo;s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and people driving them out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">All the stores was along one street. They had white-domestic awnings in front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts. There was empty dry-goods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">a mighty ornery lot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but didn&rsquo;t wear no coats nor waistcoats; they called one another Bill, and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used considerable many cuss-words. There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands in his britches pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch. What a body was hearing amongst them, all the time was</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gimme a chaw &rsquo;v tobacker, Hank.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cain&rsquo;t</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I hain&rsquo;t got but one chaw left. Ask Bill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain&rsquo;t got none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a chaw of tobacco of their own. They get all their chawing by borrowing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they say to a fellow, &ldquo;I wisht you&rsquo;d len&rsquo; me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which is a lie, pretty much every time; it don&rsquo;t fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain&rsquo;t no stranger, so he says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You give him a chaw, did you? so did your sister&rsquo;s cat&rsquo;s grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you&rsquo;ve awready borry&rsquo;d off&rsquo;n me, Lafe Buckner, then I&rsquo;ll loan you one or two ton of it, and won&rsquo;t charge you no back intrust, nuther.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I did pay you back some of it wunst.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, you did</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rsquo;bout six chaws. You borry&rsquo;d store tobacker and paid back slave tobacker.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted. When they borrow a chaw, they don&rsquo;t generly cut it off with knife, but they set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it&rsquo;s handed back, and says, sarcastic</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here, gimme the chaw, and you take the plug.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">All the streets and lanes was just mud, they warn&rsquo;t nothing else but mud</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">mud as black as tar, and nigh about a foot deep in some places; and two or three inches deep in all the places. The hogs loafed and grunted around, everywheres. You&rsquo;d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had to walk around her, and she&rsquo;d stretch out, and shut her eyes, and wave her ears, whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you&rsquo;d hear a loafer sing out, &ldquo;Hi! so boy! sick him, Tige!&rdquo; and away the sow would go, squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise. Then they&rsquo;d settle back again till there was a dog-fight. There couldn&rsquo;t anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all over, like a dog-fight</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people had moved out of them. The bank was caved away under one corner of some others, and that corner was hanging over. People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back, and back, and back, because the river&rsquo;s always gnawing at it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The nearer it got to noon that day, the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time. Families fetched their dinners with them, from the country, and eat them in the wagons. There was considerable whiskey drinking going on, and I seen three fights. By-and- by somebody sings out</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here comes old Boggs!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">in from the country for his little old monthly drunk</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">here he comes, boys!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">All the loafers looked glad</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs. One of them says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wonder who he&rsquo;s a gwyne to chaw up this time. If he&rsquo;d a chawed up all the men he&rsquo;s ben a gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year, he&rsquo;d have considerble ruputation, now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Another one says, &ldquo;I wisht old Boggs&rsquo;d threaten me, &rsquo;cuz then I&rsquo;d know I warn&rsquo;t gwyne to die for a thousan&rsquo; year.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an Indian, and singing out</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cler the track, thar. I&rsquo;m on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is a gwyne to raise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year old, and had a very red face. Everybody yelled at him, and laughed at him, and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he&rsquo;d attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn&rsquo;t wait now, because he&rsquo;d come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, &ldquo;meat first, and spoon vittles to top off on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He see me, and rode up and says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whar&rsquo;d you come f&rsquo;m, boy? You prepared to die?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he rode on. I was scared; but a man says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t mean nothing; he&rsquo;s always a carryin&rsquo; on like that, when he&rsquo;s drunk. He&rsquo;s the best-naturedest old fool in Arkansaw</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">never hurt nobody, drunk nor sober.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning, and yells</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you&rsquo;ve swindled. You&rsquo;re the houn&rsquo; I&rsquo;m after, and I&rsquo;m a gwyne to have you, too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on. By-and-by a proud-looking man about fifty-five</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and he was a heap the best dressed man in that town, too</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">steps out of the store, and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come. He says to Boggs, mighty ca&rsquo;m and slow</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of this; but I&rsquo;ll endure it till one o&rsquo;clock. Till one o&rsquo;clock, mind</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">no longer. If you open your mouth against me only once, after that time, you can&rsquo;t travel so far but I will find you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody stirred, and there warn&rsquo;t no more laughing. Boggs rode off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping it up. Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up, but he wouldn&rsquo;t; they told him it would be one o&rsquo;clock in about fifteen minutes, and so he must go home</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">he must go right away. But it didn&rsquo;t do no good. He cussed away, with all his might, and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn&rsquo;t no use</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">up the street he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing. By-and-by somebody says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go for his daughter!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he&rsquo;ll listen to her. If anybody can persuade him, she can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So somebody started on a run. I walked down street a ways, and stopped. In about five or ten minutes, here comes Boggs again</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but not on his horse. He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bareheaded, with a friend on both sides of him aholt of his arms and hurrying him along. He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn&rsquo;t hanging back any, but was doing some of the hurrying himself. Somebody sings out</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Boggs!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel Sherburn. He was standing perfectly still, in the street, and had a pistol raised in his right hand</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">not aiming it, but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky. The same second I see a young girl coming on the run, and two men with her. Boggs and the men turned round, to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side, and the pistol barrel come down slow and steady to a level</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands, and says, &ldquo;O Lord, don&rsquo;t shoot!&rdquo; Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back clawing at the air</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards onto the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out. That young girl screamed out, and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her father, crying, and saying, &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s killed him, he&rsquo;s killed him!&rdquo; The crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to shove them back, and shouting, &ldquo;Back, back! give him air, give him air!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol onto the ground, and turned around on his heels and walked off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around, just the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in. They laid him on the floor, and put one large Bible under his head, and opened another one and spread it on his breast</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but they tore open his shirt first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in. He made about a dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and after that he laid still; he was dead. Then they pulled his daughter away from him, screaming and crying, and took her off. She was about sixteen, and very sweet and gentle-looking, but awful pale and scared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people that had the places wouldn&rsquo;t give them up, and folks behind them was saying all the time, &ldquo;Say, now, you&rsquo;ve looked enough, you fellows; &rsquo;taint right and &rsquo;taint fair, for you to stay thar all the time, and never give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe there was going to be trouble. The streets was full, and everybody was excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened, and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows, stretching their necks and listening. One long lanky man, with long hair and a big white fur stove-pipe hat on the back of his head, and a crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood, and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from one place to t&rsquo;other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung out, &ldquo;Boggs!&rdquo; and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; staggered backwards, says &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; again, and fell down flat on his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect; said it was just exactly the way it all happened. Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, by-and-by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. In about a minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and snatching down every clothes-line they come to, to do the hanging with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.d5v13tq5wjhf"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 22</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They swarmed up the street towards Sherburn&rsquo;s house, a-whooping and yelling and raging like Indians, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush, and it was awful to see. Children was heeling it ahead of the mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along the road was full of women&rsquo;s heads, and there was slave boys in every tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach. Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared most to death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They swarmed up in front of Sherburn&rsquo;s palings as thick as they could jam together, and you couldn&rsquo;t hear yourself think for the noise. It was a little twenty-foot yard. Some sung out &ldquo;Tear down the fence! tear down the fence!&rdquo; Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch, with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly ca&rsquo;m and deliberate, not saying a word. The racket stopped, and the wave sucked back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sherburn never said a word</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">just stood there, looking down. The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable. Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck, the people tried a little to outgaze him, but they couldn&rsquo;t; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that&rsquo;s got sand in it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he says, slow and scornful:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The idea of you lynching anybody! It&rsquo;s amusing. The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man! Because you&rsquo;re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man ? Why, a man&rsquo;s safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">as long as it&rsquo;s day-time and you&rsquo;re not behind him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the South, and I&rsquo;ve lived in the North; so I know the average all around. The average man&rsquo;s a coward. In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it. In the South one man, all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men, in the day-time, and robbed the lot. Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">whereas you&rsquo;re just as brave, and no braver. Why don&rsquo;t your juries hang murderers? Because they&rsquo;re afraid the man&rsquo;s friends will shoot them in the back, in the dark</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and it&rsquo;s just what they would do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So they always acquit; and then a man goes in the night, with a hundred masked cowards at his back, and lynches the rascal. Your mistake is, that you didn&rsquo;t bring a man with you; that&rsquo;s one mistake, and the other is that you didn&rsquo;t come in the dark, and fetch your masks. You brought part of a man! Buck Harkness, there</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and if you hadn&rsquo;t had him to start you, you&rsquo;d a taken it out in blowing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want to come. The average man don&rsquo;t like trouble and danger. You don&rsquo;t like trouble and danger. But if only half a man</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">like Buck Harkness, there</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">shouts &lsquo;Lynch him, lynch him!&rsquo; you&rsquo;re afraid to back down</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">afraid you&rsquo;ll be found out to be what you are</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">cowards</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves onto that half-a-man&rsquo;s coat tall, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you&rsquo;re going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that&rsquo;s what an army is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">a mob; they don&rsquo;t fight with courage that&rsquo;s born in them, but with courage that&rsquo;s borrowed from their mass, and from their officers. But a mob without any man at the head of it, is beneath pitifulness. Now the thing for you to do, is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole. If any real lynching&rsquo;s going to be done, it will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they&rsquo;ll bring their masks, and fetch a man along. Now leave</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and take your half-a-man with you&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it, when he says this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking tolerable cheap. I could a staid, if I&rsquo;d a wanted to, but I didn&rsquo;t want to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I went to the circus, and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by, and then dived in under the tent. I had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because there ain&rsquo;t no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from home and amongst strangers, that way. You can&rsquo;t be too careful. I ain&rsquo;t opposed to spending money on circuses, when there ain&rsquo;t no other way, but there ain&rsquo;t no use in wasting it on them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was a real bully circus. It was the splendidest sight that ever was, when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side by side, the men just in their drawers and under-shirts, and no shoes nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs, easy and comfortable</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there must a&rsquo; been twenty of them</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and every lady with a lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just littered with diamonds. It was a powerful fine sight; I never see anything so lovely. And then one by one they got up and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and every lady&rsquo;s rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips, and she looking like the most loveliest parasol.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot stuck out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and the ring-master going round and round the center-pole, cracking his whip and shouting &ldquo;hi!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">hi!&rdquo; and the clown cracking jokes behind him; and by-and-by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves! And so, one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. The ring-master couldn&rsquo;t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever could think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn&rsquo;t noway understand. Why, I couldn&rsquo;t a thought of them in a year. And by-and-by a drunk man tried to get into the ring</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn&rsquo;t listen, and the whole show come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, &ldquo;Knock him down! throw him out!&rdquo; and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ring-master he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn&rsquo;t be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn&rsquo;t make no more trouble, he would let him ride, if he thought he could stay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging onto his bridle trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging onto his neck, and his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till the tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t&rsquo;other one on t&rsquo;other side, and the people just crazy. It warn&rsquo;t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse agoing like a house afire too. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn&rsquo;t ever drunk in his life</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then the ring-master he see how he had been fooled, and he was the sickest ring-master you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his own men! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough, to be took in so, but I wouldn&rsquo;t a been in that ring-master&rsquo;s place, not for a thousand dollars. I don&rsquo;t know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them yet. Anyways it was plenty good enough for me; and wherever I run across it, it can have all of my custom, every time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, that night we had our show; but there warn&rsquo;t only about twelve people there; just enough to pay expenses. And they laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which was asleep. So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn&rsquo;t come up to Shakspeare; what they wanted was low comedy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned. He said he could size their style. So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping-paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills and stuck them up all over the village. The bills said:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">AT THE COURT HOUSE!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">FOR 3 NIGHTS ONLY!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The World-Renowned Tragedians</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">AND</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of the London and Continental</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Theatres,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In their Thrilling Tragedy of</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">THE KING&rsquo;S CAMELOPARD</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">OR</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">THE ROYAL NONESUCH! ! !</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Admission 50 cents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then at the bottom was the biggest line of all</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which said:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if that line don&rsquo;t fetch them, I don&rsquo;t know Arkansaw!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.42qtdl2k6etj"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 23</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage, and a curtain, and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time. When the place couldn&rsquo;t hold no more, the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come onto the stage and stood up before the curtain, and made a little speech, and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy and about Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it; and at last when he&rsquo;d got everybody&rsquo;s expectations up high enough, he rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over, ringstreaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow. And</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but never mind the rest of his outfit, it was just wild, but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering, and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again; and after that, they made him do it another time. Well, it would a made a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says the great tragedy will he performed only two nights more, on accounts of pressing London engagements, where the seats, is all sold aready for it in Drury Lane and then he makes them another bow, and, says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Twenty people sings out:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, is it over? Is that all ?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke says yes. Then there was a fine time. Everybody sings out &ldquo;sold,&rdquo; and rose up mad, and was agoing for that stage and them tragedians. But a big fine-looking man jumps up on a bench, and shouts:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on! Just a word, gentlemen.&rdquo; They stopped to listen. &ldquo;We are sold</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">mighty badly sold. But we don&rsquo;t want to be the laughing-stock of this whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live. No. What we want, is to go out of here quiet, and talk this show up, and sell the rest of the town! Then we&rsquo;ll all be in the same boat. Ain&rsquo;t that sensible?&rdquo; (&ldquo;You bet it is!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the jedge is right!&rdquo; everybody sings out.) &ldquo;All right, then</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">not a word about any sell. Go along home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Next day you couldn&rsquo;t hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was. House was jammed again, that night, and we sold this crowd the same way. When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft, we all had a supper; and by-and-by, about midnight, they made Jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The third night the house was crammed again</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and they warn&rsquo;t new-corners, this time, but people that was at the show the other two nights. I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and I see it warn&rsquo;t no perfumery neither, not by a long sight. I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the signs of a dead eat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four of them went in. I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various for me, I couldn&rsquo;t stand it. Well, when the place couldn&rsquo;t hold no more people, the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark, he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Walk fast, now, till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I done it, and he done the same. We struck the raft at the same time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a word. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience; but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, how&rsquo;d the old thing pan out this time, Duke?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He hadn&rsquo;t been up town at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below that village. Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they&rsquo;d served them people. The duke says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Greenhorns, flatheads! I knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they&rsquo;d lay for us the third night, and consider it was their turn now. Well, it is their turn, and I&rsquo;d give something to know how much they&rsquo;d take for it. I would just like to know how they&rsquo;re putting in their opportunity. They can turn it into a picnic, if they want to</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they brought plenty provisions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights. I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that, before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">By-and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t it &rsquo;sprise you, de way dem kings carries on, Huck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t it, Huck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it don&rsquo;t, because it&rsquo;s in the breed. I reckon they&rsquo;re all alike.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, Huck, dese kings o&rsquo; ourn is regular rapscallions; dat&rsquo;s jist what dey is; dey&rsquo;s reglar rapscallions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur as I can make out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is dat so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You read about them once</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you&rsquo;ll see. Look at Henry the Eight; this&rsquo;n &rsquo;s a Sunday-School Superintendent to him. And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain. My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. He was a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. &lsquo;Fetch up Nell Gwynn,&rsquo; he says. They fetch her up. Next morning, &lsquo;Chop off her head!&rsquo; And they chop it off. &lsquo;Fetch up Jane Shore,&rsquo; he says; and up she comes. Next morning &lsquo;Chop off her head&rsquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and they chop it off. &lsquo;Ring up Fair Rosamun.&rsquo; Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning, &lsquo;Chop off her head.&rsquo; And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which was a good name and stated the case. You don&rsquo;t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I&rsquo;ve struck in history. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">give notice?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">give the country a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was his style</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">ask him to show up? No</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. Spose people left money laying around where he was</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what did he do? He collared it. Spose he contracted to do a thing; and you paid him, and didn&rsquo;t set down there and see that he done it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what did he do? He always done the other thing. Spose he opened his mouth</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what then? If he didn&rsquo;t shut it up powerful quick, he&rsquo;d lose a lie, every time. That&rsquo;s the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we&rsquo;d a had him along &rsquo;stead of our kings, he&rsquo;d a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don&rsquo;t say that ourn is lambs, because they ain&rsquo;t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain&rsquo;t nothing to that old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they&rsquo;re a mighty ornery lot. It&rsquo;s the way they&rsquo;re raised.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But dis one do smell so like de nation, Huck.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, they all do, Jim. We can&rsquo;t help the way a king smells; history don&rsquo;t tell no way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now de duke, he&rsquo;s a tolerble likely man, in some ways.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, a duke&rsquo;s different. But not very different. This one&rsquo;s a middling hard lot, for a duke. When he&rsquo;s drunk, there ain&rsquo;t no near-sighted man could tell him from a king.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, anyways, I doan&rsquo; hanker for no mo&rsquo; un um, Huck. Dese is all I kin stan&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way I feel, too, Jim. But we&rsquo;ve got them on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances. Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that&rsquo;s out of kings.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">What was the use to tell Jim these warn&rsquo;t real kings and dukes? It wouldn&rsquo;t a done no good; and besides, it was just as I said; you couldn&rsquo;t tell them from the real kind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I went to sleep, and Jim didn&rsquo;t call me when it was my turn. He often done that. When I waked up, just at day-break, he was setting there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself. I didn&rsquo;t take notice, nor let on. I knowed what it was about. He was thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn&rsquo;t ever been away from home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their&rsquo;n. It don&rsquo;t seem natural, but I reckon it&rsquo;s so. He was often moaning and mourning that way, nights, when he judged I was asleep, and saying, &ldquo;Po&rsquo; little &rsquo;Lizabeth! po&rsquo; little Johnny! its mighty hard; I spec&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t ever gwyne to see you no mo&rsquo;, no mo&rsquo;!&rdquo; He was a mighty good slave, Jim was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones; and by-and-by he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What makes me feel so bad dis time, &rsquo;uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me or de time I treat my little &rsquo;Lizabeth so ornery.

Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn&rsquo;t take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on him all by himself and not tied, it wouldn&rsquo;t took much like he was a runaway slave, you know. So the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day, and he&rsquo;d cipher out some way to get around it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He dressed Jim up in King Lear&rsquo;s outfit</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theatre-paint and painted Jim&rsquo;s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead dull solid blue, like a man that&rsquo;s been drownded nine days. Blamed if he warn&rsquo;t the horriblest looking outrage I ever see. Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sick Arab</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but harmless when not out of his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a sight better than laying tied a couple of years every day and trembling all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if any body ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn&rsquo;t wait for him to howl. Why, he didn&rsquo;t only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn&rsquo;t be safe, because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time. They couldn&rsquo;t hit no project that suited, exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he&rsquo;d lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn&rsquo;t put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop over to t&rsquo;other village, without any plan, but just trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">meaning the devil, I reckon. We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his&rsquo;n on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course. The king&rsquo;s duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy. I never knowed how clothes could change a body before. Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he&rsquo;d take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you&rsquo;d say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about three mile above town</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">been there a couple of hours, taking on freight. Says the king:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seein&rsquo; how I&rsquo;m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St. Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. Go for the steamboat, Huckleberry; we&rsquo;ll come down to the village on her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t have to be ordered twice, to go and take a steamboat ride. I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a couple of big carpet-bags by him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Run her nose in shore,&rdquo; says the king. I done it. &ldquo;Wher&rsquo; you bound for, young man?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For the steamboat; going to Orleans.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Git aboard,&rdquo; says the king. &ldquo;Hold on a minute, my servant&rsquo;ll he&rsquo;p you with them bags. Jump out and he&rsquo;p the gentleman, Adolphus&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">meaning me, I see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage [in] such weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he&rsquo;d come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. The young fellow says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When I first see you, I says to myself, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Wilks, sure, and he come mighty near getting here in time.&rsquo; But then I says again, &lsquo;No, I reckon it ain&rsquo;t him, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t be paddling up the river.&rsquo; You ain&rsquo;t him, are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, my name&rsquo;s Blodgett</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Elexander Blodgett</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Reverend Elexander Blodgett, I spose I must say, as I&rsquo;m one o&rsquo; the Lord&rsquo;s poor servants. But still I&rsquo;m jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he&rsquo;s missed anything by it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which I hope he hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, he don&rsquo;t miss any property by it, because he&rsquo;ll get that all right; but he&rsquo;s missed seeing his brother Peter die</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which he mayn&rsquo;t mind, nobody can tell as to that</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but his brother would a give anything in this world to see him before he died; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn&rsquo;t seen him since they was boys together</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and hadn&rsquo;t ever seen his brother William at all</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s the deef and dumb one</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">William ain&rsquo;t more than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and George was the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey and William&rsquo;s the only ones that&rsquo;s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven&rsquo;t got here in time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did anybody send &rsquo;em word?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn&rsquo;t going to get well this time. You see, he was pretty old, and George&rsquo;s g&rsquo;yirls was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane the red-headed one; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn&rsquo;t seem to care much to live. He most desperately wanted to see Harvey</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and William too, for that matter</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">because he was one of them kind that can&rsquo;t bear to make a will. He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he&rsquo;d told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George&rsquo;s g&rsquo;yirls would be all right</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">for George didn&rsquo;t leave nothing. And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why do you reckon Harvey don&rsquo;t come? Wher&rsquo; does he live?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, he lives in England</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Sheffield</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">preaches there</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">hasn&rsquo;t ever been in this country. He hasn&rsquo;t had any too much time</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and besides he mightn&rsquo;t a got the letter at all, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Too bad, too bad he couldn&rsquo;t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, but that ain&rsquo;t only a part of it. I&rsquo;m going in a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty long journey. But it&rsquo;ll be lovely; I wisht I was agoing. Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mary Jane&rsquo;s nineteen, Susan&rsquo;s fifteen, and Joanna&rsquo;s about fourteen</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they ain&rsquo;t going to let them come to no harm. There&rsquo;s Hobson, the Babtis&rsquo; preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">well, there&rsquo;s a lot of them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey&rsquo;ll know where to look for friends when he get&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, the old man he went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow. Blamed if he didn&rsquo;t inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about all the Wilkses; and about Peter&rsquo;s business</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which was a tanner; and about George&rsquo;s</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which was a carpenter; and about Harvey&rsquo;s</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on. Then he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn&rsquo;t stop there. When they&rsquo;re deep they won&rsquo;t stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Was Peter Wilks well off?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it&rsquo;s reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som&rsquo;ers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When did you say he died?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say, but it was last night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Funeral tomorrow, likely?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;bout the middle of the day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all terrible sad; but we&rsquo;ve all got to go, one time or another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, sir, it&rsquo;s the best way. Ma used to always say that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When we struck the boat, she was about done loading, and pretty soon she got off. The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost my ride, after all. When the boat was gone, the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new carpet-bags. And if he&rsquo;s gone over to t&rsquo;other side, go over there and git him. And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I see what he was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. When I got back with the duke, we hid the canoe and then they set down on a log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had said it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">every last word of it. And all the time he was a doing it, he tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well too, for a slouch. I can&rsquo;t imitate him, and so I ain&rsquo;t agoing to try to; but he really done it pretty good. Then he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histrionic boards. So then they waited for a steamboat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but they didn&rsquo;t come from high enough up the river; but at last there was a big one, and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we went aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile, they was booming mad, and give us a cussing, and said they wouldn&rsquo;t land us. But the king was ca&rsquo;m. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece, to be took on and put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry &rsquo;em, can&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the village, they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down, when they see the yawl a coming; and when the king says</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher&rsquo; Mr. Peter Wilks lives?&rdquo; they give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say, &ldquo;What d&rsquo; I tell you?&rdquo; Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he did live yesterday evening.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sudden as winking, the ornery old cretur went all to smash, and fell up against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his back, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alas, alas, our poor brother</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">gone, and we never got to see him; oh, it&rsquo;s too, too hard!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn&rsquo;t drop a carpet-bag and bust out a-crying. If they warn&rsquo;t the beatenest lot, them two frauds, that ever I struck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, the men gethered around, and sympathized with them, and said all sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about his brother&rsquo;s last moments, and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they&rsquo;d lost the twelve disciples. Well, if ever I struck anything like it, I&rsquo;m a slave. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.y82ojbrc7bl3"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 25</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people tearing down on the run, from every which way, some of them putting on their coats as they come. Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier-march. The windows and door-yards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it them ?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You bet it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When we got to the house, the street in front of it was packed, and the three girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane was red-headed, but that don&rsquo;t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had it! Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then the king he hunched the duke, private</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I see him do it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and then he looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so then, him and the duke, with a hand across each other&rsquo;s shoulder, and t&rsquo;other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping, people saying &ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And when they got there, they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then they bust out a crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other&rsquo;s necks, and hung their chins over each other&rsquo;s shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done. And mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything like it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t&rsquo;other on t&rsquo;other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to theirselves. Well, when it come to that, it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and so everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running down, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next woman a show. I never see anything so disgusting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, by-and-by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and works himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive, after the long journey of four thousand mile, but its a trial that&rsquo;s sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother&rsquo;s heart, because out of their mouths they can&rsquo;t, words being too weak and cold, and all that kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And the minute the words was out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their might, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash, I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and bully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up with the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak, he knows who he would name, for they was names that was very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will name the same, to-wit, as follows, vizz:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town, a-hunting together; that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t&rsquo;other world, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was away up to Louisville on some business. But the rest was on hand, and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him; and then they shook hands with the duke, and didn&rsquo;t say nothing but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said &ldquo;Goo-goo</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">goo-goo-goo,&rdquo; all the time, like a baby that can&rsquo;t talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So the king he blatted along, and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to George&rsquo;s family, or to Peter; and he always let on that Peter wrote him the things, but that was a lie, he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the king he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard (which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and land (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid, down cellar. So these two frauds said they&rsquo;d go and fetch it up, and have everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle. We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them yaller-boys. My, the way the king&rsquo;s eyes did shine! He slaps the duke on the shoulder, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, this ain&rsquo;t bully, nor noth&rsquo;n! Oh, no, I reckon not! Why, Biljy, it beats the Nonesuch, don&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke allowed it did. They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the king says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no use talkin&rsquo;; bein&rsquo; brothers to a rich dead man, and representatives of furrin heirs that&rsquo;s got left, is the line for you and me, Bilge. Thish-yer comes of trust&rsquo;n to Providence. It&rsquo;s the best way, in the long run. I&rsquo;ve tried &rsquo;em all, and ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no better way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on trust; but no, they must count it. So they counts it, and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short. Says the king:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hunderd and fifteen dollars?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They worried over that a while, and ransacked all around for it. Then the duke says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I reckon that&rsquo;s the way of it. The best way&rsquo;s to let it go, and keep still about it. We can spare it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, shucks, yes, we can spare it. I don&rsquo;t k&rsquo;yer noth&rsquo;n &rsquo;bout that</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it&rsquo;s the count I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; about. We want to be awful square and open and above-board, here, you know. We want to lug this h-yer money up stairs and count it before everybody</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">then ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t noth&rsquo;n suspicious. But when the dead man says ther&rsquo;s six thous&rsquo;n dollars, you know, we don&rsquo;t want to</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; says the duke. &ldquo;Less make up the deffisit&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and he begun to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a most amaz&rsquo;n&rsquo; good idea, duke</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you have got a rattlin&rsquo; clever head on you,&rdquo; says the king. &ldquo;Blest if the old Nonesuch ain&rsquo;t a heppin&rsquo; us out agin&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and he begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; says the duke, &ldquo;I got another idea. Le&rsquo;s go up stairs and count this money, and then take and give it to the girls.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good land, duke, lemme hug you! It&rsquo;s the most dazzling idea &rsquo;at ever a man struck. You have cert&rsquo;nly got the most astonishin&rsquo; head I ever see. Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no mistake &rsquo;bout it. Let &rsquo;em fetch along their suspicions now, if they want to</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">this&rsquo;ll lay &rsquo;em out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When we got upstairs, everybody gethered around the table, and the king he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">twenty elegant little piles. Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their chops. Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder, has done generous by them that&rsquo;s left behind in the vale of sorrers. He has done generous by these-yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that&rsquo;s left fatherless and motherless. Yes, and we that knowed him, knows that he would a done more generous by &rsquo;em if he hadn&rsquo;t ben afeard o&rsquo; woundin&rsquo; his dear William and me. Now, wouldn&rsquo;t he? Ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no question &rsquo;bout it, in my mind. Well, then</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what kind o&rsquo; brothers would it be, that&rsquo;d stand in his way at sech a time? And what kind o&rsquo; uncles would it be that&rsquo;d rob</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">yes, rob </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">sech poor sweet lambs as these &rsquo;at he loved so, at sech a time? If I know William</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and I think I do</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">he</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">well, I&rsquo;ll jest ask him.&rdquo; He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands; and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather-headed a while, then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy, and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up. Then the king says, &ldquo;I knowed it; I reckon that&rsquo; ll convince anybody the way he feels about it. Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">take it all. It&rsquo;s the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet. And everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands off of them frauds, saying all the time:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You dear good souls!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">how lovely !</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">how could you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside, and stood a listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody saying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was all busy listening. The king was saying</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">in the middle of something he&rsquo;d started in on</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they bein&rsquo; partickler friends o&rsquo; the diseased. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re invited here this evenin&rsquo;; but tomorrow we want all to come</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">everybody; for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it&rsquo;s fitten that his funeral orgies h&rsquo;d be public.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke he couldn&rsquo;t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper, &ldquo;obsequies, you old fool,&rdquo; and folds it up and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people&rsquo;s heads to him. The king he reads it, and puts it in his pocket, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Poor William, afflicted as he is, his heart&rsquo;s aluz right. Asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">wants me to make &rsquo;em all welcome. But he needn&rsquo;t a worried</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it was jest what I was at.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca&rsquo;m, and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before. And when he done it the third time, he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I say orgies, not because it&rsquo;s the common term, because it ain&rsquo;t</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">obsequies bein&rsquo; the common term</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but because orgies is the right term. Obsequies ain&rsquo;t used in England no more, now</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it&rsquo;s gone out. We say orgies now, in England. Orgies is better, because it means the thing you&rsquo;re after, more exact. It&rsquo;s a word that&rsquo;s made up out&rsquo;n the Greek orgo, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew jeesum, to plant, cover up; hence inter</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public funeral.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He was the worst I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed right in his face. Everybody was shocked. Everybody says, &ldquo;Why doctor!&rdquo; and Abner Shackleford says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Robinson, hain&rsquo;t you heard the news? This is Harvey Wilks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it my poor brother&rsquo;s dear good friend and physician? I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Keep your hands off of me!&rdquo; says the doctor. &ldquo;You talk like an Englishman</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">don&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s the worse imitation I ever heard. You Peter Wilks&rsquo;s brother. You&rsquo;re a fraud, that&rsquo;s what you are!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, how they all took on! They crowded around the doctor, and tried to quiet him down, and tried to explain to him, and tell him how Harvey&rsquo;d showed in forty ways that he was Harvey, and knowed everybody by name, and the names of the very dogs, and begged and begged him not to hurt Harvey&rsquo;s feelings and the poor girls&rsquo; feelings, and all that; but it warn&rsquo;t no use, he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and couldn&rsquo;t imitate the lingo no better than what he did, was a fraud and a liar. The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on them. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was your father&rsquo;s friend, and I&rsquo;m your friend; and I warn you as a friend, and an honest one, that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel, and have nothing to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew as he calls it. He is the thinnest kind of an impostor</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">has come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he has picked up somewheres, and you take them for proofs, and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here, who ought to know better. Mary Jane Wilks, you know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too. Now listen to me; turn this pitiful rascal out</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I beg you to do it. Will you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome! She says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here is my answer.&rdquo; She hove up the bag of money and put it in the king&rsquo;s hands, and says, &ldquo;Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to, and don&rsquo;t give us no receipt for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the harelip done the same on the other. Everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud. The doctor says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, I wash my hands of the matter. But I warn you all that a time&rsquo;s coming when you&rsquo;re going to feel sick whenever you think of this day&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and away he went.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, doctor,&rdquo; says the king, kinder mocking him, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll try and get &rsquo;em to send for you&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which made them all laugh, and they said it was a prime good hit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.eqvq9aunh3aw"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 26</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well when they was all gone, the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for Uncle William, and she&rsquo;d give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was a little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby with a pallet in it. The king said the cubby would do for his valley</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">meaning me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was plain but nice. She said she&rsquo;d have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey&rsquo;s way, but he said they warn&rsquo;t. The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor. There was an old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar box in another, and all sorts of little knick-knacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room with. The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings, and so don&rsquo;t disturb them. The duke&rsquo;s room was pretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there, and I stood behind the king and the duke&rsquo;s chairs and waited on them, and the slaves waited on the rest. Mary Jane she set at the head of the table, with Susan along side of her, and said how bad the biscuits was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tip-top, and said so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">said &ldquo;How do you get biscuits to brown so nice?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where, for the land&rsquo;s sake did you get these amaz&rsquo;n pickles?&rdquo; and all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a supper, you know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And when it was all done, me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the slaves clean up the things. The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest if I didn&rsquo;t think the ice was getting mighty thin, sometimes. She says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you ever see the king?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who? William Fourth? Well, I bet I have</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">he goes to our church.&rdquo; I knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on. So when I says he goes to our church, she says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">regular?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">regular. His pew&rsquo;s right over opposite ourn</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">on &lsquo;tother side the pulpit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I thought he lived in London?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, he does. Where would he live?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I thought you lived in Sheffield?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I see I was up a stump. I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. Then I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I mean he goes to our church regular when he&rsquo;s in Sheffield. That&rsquo;s only in the summer-time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, how you talk</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Sheffield ain&rsquo;t on the sea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, who said it was?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, you did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, nuther.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You did!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I never said nothing of the kind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, what did you say, then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Said he come to take the sea baths</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that&rsquo;s what I said.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then! how&rsquo;s he going to take the sea baths if it ain&rsquo;t on the sea?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looky here,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;did you ever see any Congress water?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, no.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How does he get it, then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">in barrels. There in the palace at Sheffield they&rsquo;ve got furnaces, and he wants his water hot. They can&rsquo;t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea. They haven&rsquo;t got no conveniences for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I see, now. You might a said that in the first place and saved time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When she said that, I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was comfortable and glad. Next, she says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you go to church, too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">regular.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where do you set?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, in our pew.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whose pew?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, ourn</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;your Uncle Harvey&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;His&rsquo;n?

I see I was up a stump again, so I played another chicken bone and got another think. Then I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Blame it, do you suppose there ain&rsquo;t but one preacher to a church?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, what do they want with more?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">to preach before a king?

But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant, and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of it&rsquo;s being the law. But I didn&rsquo;t do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she warn&rsquo;t satisfied. She says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honest, now, hain&rsquo;t you been telling a lot of lies?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honest,&rdquo; says I.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;None of it at all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;None of it at all. Not a lie in it,&rdquo; says I.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lay your hand on this book and say it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I see it warn&rsquo;t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and said it. So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I&rsquo;ll believe the rest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it you won&rsquo;t believe, Joe?&rdquo; says Mary Jane, stepping in with Susan behind her. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t right nor kind for you to talk so to him, and him a stranger and so far from his people. How would you like to be treated so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s always your way, Maim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">always sailing in to help somebody before they&rsquo;re hurt. I hain&rsquo;t done nothing to him. He&rsquo;s told some stretchers, I reckon; and I said I wouldn&rsquo;t swallow it all; and that&rsquo;s every bit and grain I did say. I reckon he can stand a little thing like that, can&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether &rsquo;twas little or whether &rsquo;twas big, he&rsquo;s here in our house and a stranger, and it wasn&rsquo;t good of you to say it. If you was in his place, it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn&rsquo;t to say a thing to another person that will make them feel ashamed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Maim, he said</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make no difference what he said</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that ain&rsquo;t the thing. The thing is for you to treat him kind, and not be saying things to make him remember he ain&rsquo;t in his own country and amongst his own folks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I says to myself, this is a girl that I&rsquo;m letting that old reptile rob her of her money!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then Susan she waltzed in; and if you&rsquo;ll believe me, she did give Hare-lip hark from the tomb!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Says I to myself, And this is another one that I&rsquo;m letting him rob her of her money!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely again</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which was her way</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but when she got done there warn&rsquo;t hardly anything left o&rsquo; poor Hare-lip. So she hollered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; says the other girls, &ldquo;you just ask his pardon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She done it, too. And she done it beautiful. She done it so beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so she could do it again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I says to myself, this is another one that I&rsquo;m letting him rob her of her money. And when she got through, they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. I felt so ornery and low down and mean, that I says to myself, My mind&rsquo;s made up; I&rsquo;ll hive that money for them or bust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So then I lit out</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">for bed, I said, meaning some time or another. When I got by myself, I went to thinking the thing over. I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? No</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that won&rsquo;t do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me. Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I dasn&rsquo;t do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they&rsquo;ve got the money, and they&rsquo;d slide right out and get away with it. If she was to fetch in help, I&rsquo;d get mixed up in the business, before it was done with, I judge. No, there ain&rsquo;t no good way but one. I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won&rsquo;t suspicion that I done it. They&rsquo;ve got a good thing, here; and they ain&rsquo;t agoing to leave till they&rsquo;ve played this family and this town for all they&rsquo;re worth, so I&rsquo;ll find a chance time enough. I&rsquo;ll steal it, and hide it; and by-and-by, when I&rsquo;m away down the river, I&rsquo;ll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it&rsquo;s hid. But I better hive it tonight, if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn&rsquo;t let up as much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here, yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So, thinks I, I&rsquo;ll go and search them rooms. Upstairs the hall was dark, but I found the duke&rsquo;s room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn&rsquo;t be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn&rsquo;t do nothing without a candle, and I dasn&rsquo;t light one, of course. So I judged I&rsquo;d got to do the other thing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">lay for them, and eavesdrop. About that time, I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn&rsquo;t where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane&rsquo;s frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn&rsquo;t found the bed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private. They sets down, then, and the king says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, what is it? and cut it middlin&rsquo; short, because it&rsquo;s better for us to be down there a whoopin&rsquo;-up the mournin&rsquo;, than up here givin&rsquo; &rsquo;em a chance to talk us over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, this is it, Capet. I ain&rsquo;t easy; I ain&rsquo;t comfortable. That doctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I&rsquo;ve got a notion, and I think it&rsquo;s a sound one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it, duke?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That we better glide out of this, before three in the morning, and clip it down the river with what we&rsquo;ve got. Specially, seeing we got it so easy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">given back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of course we allowed to have to steal it back. I&rsquo;m for knocking off and lighting out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago, it would a been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed. The king rips out and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What! And not sell out the rest o&rsquo; the property? March off like a passel o&rsquo; fools and leave eight or nine thous&rsquo;n&rsquo; dollars&rsquo; worth o&rsquo; property layin&rsquo; around jest sufferin&rsquo; to be scooped in?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and all good salable stuff, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn&rsquo;t want to go no deeper</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">didn&rsquo;t want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, how you talk!&rdquo; says the king. &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t rob &rsquo;em of nothing at all but jest this money. The people that buys the property is the suff&rsquo;rers; because as soon&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s found out &rsquo;at we didn&rsquo;t own it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which won&rsquo;t be long after we&rsquo;ve slid</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the sale won&rsquo;t be valid, and it&rsquo;ll all go back to the estate. These-yer orphans&rsquo;ll git their house back agin, and that&rsquo;s enough for them; they&rsquo;re young and spry, and k&rsquo;n easy earn a livin&rsquo;. They ain&rsquo;t agoing to suffer. Why, jest think</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there&rsquo;s thous&rsquo;n&rsquo;s and thous&rsquo;n&rsquo;s that ain&rsquo;t nigh so well off. Bless you, they ain&rsquo;t got noth&rsquo;n to complain of.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all right, but said he believed it was blame foolishness to stay, and that doctor hanging over them. But the king says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cuss the doctor! What do we k&rsquo;yer for him ? Hain&rsquo;t we got all the fools in town on our side? and ain&rsquo;t that a big enough majority in any town?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So they got ready to go downstairs again. The duke says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we put that money in a good place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That cheered me up. I&rsquo;d begun to think I warn&rsquo;t going to get a hint of no kind to help me. The king says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because Mary Jane&rsquo;ll be in mourning from this out; and first you know the slave that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put &rsquo;em away; and do you reckon a slave can run across money and not borrow some of it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your head&rsquo;s level, agin, duke,&rdquo; says the king; and he come a fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was. I stuck tight to the wall, and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what I&rsquo;d better do if they did catch me. But the king he got the bag before I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned I was around. They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather bed, and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right, now, because a slave only makes up the feather bed, and don&rsquo;t turn over the straw tick only about twice a year, and so it warn&rsquo;t in no danger of getting stole, now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But I knowed better. I had it out of there before they was half-way downstairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I could get a chance to do better. I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking. I knowed that very well. Then I turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn&rsquo;t a gone to sleep, if I&rsquo;d a wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business. By-and-by I heard the duke come up; so I rolled off of my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder and waited to see if anything was going to happen. But nothing did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn&rsquo;t begun, yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.rtsoxp7zxw7z"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 27</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring, so I tip-toed along, and got downstairs all right. There warn&rsquo;t a sound anywheres. I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see there warn&rsquo;t nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn&rsquo;t there. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me. I run in the parlor, and took a swift look around, and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man&rsquo;s face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on. I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft, and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief and I see she begun to cry, though I couldn&rsquo;t hear her, and her back was to me. I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I&rsquo;d make sure them watchers hadn&rsquo;t seen me; so I looked through the crack and everything was all right. They hadn&rsquo;t stirred.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it. Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two, I could write back to Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain&rsquo;t the thing that&rsquo;s going to happen; the thing that&rsquo;s going to happen is, the money&rsquo;ll be found when they come to screw on the lid. Then the king&rsquo;ll get it again, and it&rsquo;ll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him. Of course I wanted to slide down and get it out of there, but I dasn&rsquo;t try it. Every minute it was getting earlier, now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir, and I might get catched</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">catehed with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn&rsquo;t hired me to take care of. I don&rsquo;t wish to be mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I got down stairs in the morning, the parlor was shut up, and the watchers was gone. There warn&rsquo;t nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their faces to see if anything had been happening, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come, with his man, and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. I see the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I dasn&rsquo;t go to look in under it, with folks around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead man&rsquo;s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. There warn&rsquo;t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor, and blowing noses</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When the place was packed full, the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and getting people and things all shipshape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passage-ways, and done it all with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn&rsquo;t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They had borrowed a melodeum</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">a sick one; and when everything was ready, a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up, right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you couldn&rsquo;t hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody didn&rsquo;t seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">just depend on me.&rdquo; Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people&rsquo;s heads. So he glided along, and the pow-wow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then, in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker&rsquo;s back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided, and glided, around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people&rsquo;s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, &ldquo;He had a rat!&rdquo; Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don&rsquo;t cost nothing, and it&rsquo;s just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn&rsquo;t no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw-driver. I was in a sweat then, and watched him pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along, as soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. So there I was! I didn&rsquo;t know whether the money was in there, or not. So, says I, spose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">now how do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not? &lsquo;Spose she dug him up and didn&rsquo;t find nothing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get hunted up and jailed; I&rsquo;d better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all; the thing&rsquo;s awful mixed, now; trying to better it, I&rsquo;ve worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I&rsquo;d just let it alone, dad fetch the whole business!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces again</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t help it, and I couldn&rsquo;t rest easy. But nothing come of it; the faces didn&rsquo;t tell me nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The king he visited around, in the evening, and sweetened every body up, and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his congregration over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away, and leave for home. He was very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn&rsquo;t be done. And he said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed, and amongst their own relations; and. it pleased the girls, too</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. Them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn&rsquo;t see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, blamed if the king didn&rsquo;t bill the house and the slaves and all the property for auction straight off</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">sale two days after the funeral; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So the next day after the funeral, along about noontime, the girls&rsquo; joy got the first jolt; a couple of slave traders come along, and the king sold them the slaves reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their mother down the river to Orleans. I thought them poor girls and them slaves would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. The girls said they hadn&rsquo;t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town. I can&rsquo;t ever get it out of my memory, the sight of them poor miserable girls and slaves hanging around each other&rsquo;s necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn&rsquo;t a stood it all but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn&rsquo;t knowed the sale warn&rsquo;t no account and the slaves would be back home in a week or two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way. It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Next day was auction day. About broad-day in the morning, the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look that there was trouble. The king says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Was you in my room night before last?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, your majesty&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which was the way I always called him when nobody but our gang warn&rsquo;t around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Was you in there yisterday er last night?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, your majesty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honor bright, now</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">no lies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honor bright, your majesty, I&rsquo;m telling you the truth. I hain&rsquo;t been anear your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Have you seen anybody else go in there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stop and think.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I studied a while, and see my chance, then I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I see the slaves go in there several times.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Both of them give a little jump; and looked like they hadn&rsquo;t ever expected it, and then like they had. Then the duke says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, all of them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">leastways not all at once. That is, I don&rsquo;t think I ever see them all come out at once but just one time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">when was that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It warn&rsquo;t early, because I overslept. I was just starting down the ladder, and I see them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, go on, go on</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what did they do? How&rsquo;d they act?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t do nothing. And they didn&rsquo;t act anyway, much, as fur as I see. They tip-toed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they&rsquo;d shoved in there to do up your majesty&rsquo;s room, or something, sposing you was up; and found you warn&rsquo;t up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn&rsquo;t already waked you up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Great guns, this is a go!&rdquo; says the king; and both of them looked pretty sick, and tolerable silly. They stood there a thinking and scratching their heads, a minute, and then the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It does beat all, how neat the slaves played their hand. They let on to be sorry they was going out of this region! and I believed they was sorry. And so did you, and so did everybody. Don&rsquo;t ever tell me any more that a slave ain&rsquo;t got any histrionic talent. Why, the way they played that thing, it would fool anybody. In my opinion there&rsquo;s a fortune in &rsquo;em. If I had capital and a theatre, I wouldn&rsquo;t want a better lay out than that</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and here we&rsquo;ve gone and sold &rsquo;em for a song. Yes, and ain&rsquo;t privileged to sing the song, yet. Say, where is that song?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that draft.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In the bank for to be collected. Where would it be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right then, thank goodness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Says I, kind of timid-like:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is something gone wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The king whirls on me and rips out:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;None o&rsquo; your business! You keep your head shet, and mind y&rsquo;r own affairs</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">if you got any. Long as you&rsquo;re in this town, don&rsquo;t you forgit that, you hear?&rdquo; Then he says to the duke, &ldquo;We got to jest swaller it, and say noth&rsquo;n: mum&rsquo;s the word for us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As they was starting down the ladder, the duke he chuckles again, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quick sales and small profits! It&rsquo;s a good business</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The king snarls around on him and says,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was trying to do for the best, in sellin&rsquo; &rsquo;m out so quick. If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin&rsquo; considable, and none to carry, is it my fault any more&rsquo;n it&rsquo;s yourn?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;d be in this house yet, and we wouldn&rsquo;t if I could a got my advice listened to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The king sassed back, as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around and lit into me again. He give me down the banks for not coming and telling him I see the slaves come out of his room acting that way</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">said any fool would a knowed something was up. And then waltzed in and cussed himself a while; and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he&rsquo;d be blamed if he&rsquo;d ever do it again. So they went off a jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I&rsquo;d worked it all off onto the slaves and yet hadn&rsquo;t done the slaves no harm by it.</span></p>

<h2 class="c15" id="h.9eafzoq01h2j"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 28</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">By-and-by it was getting-up time; so I come down the ladder and started for downstairs, but as I come to the girls&rsquo; room, the door was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she&rsquo;d been packing things in it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">getting ready to go to England. But she had stopped now, with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would. I went in there, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Miss Mary Jane, you can&rsquo;t abear to see people in trouble, and I can&rsquo;t</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">most always. Tell me about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So she done it. And it was the slaves</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I just expected it. She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn&rsquo;t know how she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and the children warn&rsquo;t ever going to see each other no more</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain&rsquo;t ever going to see each other any more!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But they will</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and inside of two weeks</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and I know it!&rdquo; says I.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Laws it was out before I could think!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and before I could budge, she throws her arms around my neck, and told me to say it again, say it again, say it again!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I see I had spoke too sudden, and said too much, and was in a close place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient and excited, and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person that&rsquo;s had a tooth pulled out. So I went to studying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place, is taking considerable many resks, though I ain&rsquo;t had no experience, and can&rsquo;t say for certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and, yet here&rsquo;s a case where I&rsquo;m blest if it don&rsquo;t look to me like the truth is better, and actuly safer, than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it&rsquo;s so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I says to myself at last, I&rsquo;m agoing to chance it; I&rsquo;ll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you&rsquo;ll go to. Then I says: &ldquo;Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways, where you could go and stay three or four days?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Mr. Lothrop&rsquo;s. Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Never mind why, yet. If I&rsquo;ll tell you how I know the slaves will see each other again</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">inside of two weeks</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">here in this house</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and prove how I know it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">will you go to Mr. Lothrop&rsquo;s and stay four days?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Four days!&rdquo; she says; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay a year!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want nothing more out of you than just your word</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I druther have it than another man&rsquo;s kiss-the-Bible.&rdquo; She smiled, and reddened up very sweet, and I says, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind it, I&rsquo;ll shut the door</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and bolt it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then I come back and set down again, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you holler. Just set still, and take it like a man. I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it&rsquo;s a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain&rsquo;t no help for it. These uncles of yourn ain&rsquo;t uncles at all</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they&rsquo;re a couples of frauds</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">regular dead-beats. There, now we&rsquo;re over the worst of it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you can stand the rest middling easy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal water now, so I went right along, her eyes a blazing higher and higher all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung herself onto the king&rsquo;s breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and then up she jumps, with her face afire like sunset, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The brute! Come</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">don&rsquo;t waste a minute</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">not a second</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;we&rsquo;ll have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Says I:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cert&rsquo;nly. But do you mean, before you go to Mr. Lothrop&rsquo;s, or</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;what am I thinking about!&rdquo; she says, and set right down again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind what I said</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">please don&rsquo;t</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you won&rsquo;t, now, will you?&rdquo; Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would die first. &ldquo;I never thought, I was so stirred up,&rdquo; she says; &ldquo;now go on, and I won&rsquo;t do so any more. You tell me what to do, and whatever you say; I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I&rsquo;m fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I druther not tell you why</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws, and I&rsquo; d be all right, but there&rsquo;d be another person that you don&rsquo;t know about who&rsquo;d be in big trouble. Well, we got to save him</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;hain&rsquo;t we? Of course. Well, then, we won&rsquo;t blow on them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Saying them words put a good idea in my head. I see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave. But I didn&rsquo;t want to run the raft in day-time without anybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn&rsquo;t want the plan to begin working till pretty late tonight. I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Miss Mary Jane, I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and you won&rsquo;t have to stay at Mr. Lothrop&rsquo;s so long, nuther. How fur is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A little short of four miles</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">right out in the country, back here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;ll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low till nine or half-past, tonight, and then get them to fetch you home again</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">tell them you&rsquo;ve thought of something. If you get here before eleven, put a candle in this window, and if I don&rsquo;t turn up, wait till eleven, and then if I don&rsquo;t turn up it means I&rsquo;m gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And if it just happens so that I don&rsquo;t get away, but get took up along with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand, and you must stand by me all you can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stand by you, indeed I will. They sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t touch a hair of your head!&rdquo; she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If I get away, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be here,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;to prove these rapscallions ain&rsquo;t your uncles, and I couldn&rsquo;t do it if I was here. I could swear they was beats and bummers, that&rsquo;s all; though that&rsquo;s worth something. Well, there&rsquo;s others can do that better than what I can</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and they&rsquo;re people that ain&rsquo;t going to be doubted as quick as I&rsquo;d be. I&rsquo;ll tell you how to find them. Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. There</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&lsquo;Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.&rsquo; Put it away, and don&rsquo;t lose it. When the court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to Bricksville and say they&rsquo;ve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch, and ask for some witnesses</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">why, you&rsquo;ll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary. And they&rsquo;ll come a-biling, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I judged we had got everything fixed about right, now. So I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just let the auction go right along, and don&rsquo;t worry. Nobody don&rsquo;t have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction, on accounts of the short notice, and they ain&rsquo;t going out of this till they get that money</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and the way we&rsquo;ve fixed it the sale ain&rsquo;t going to count, and they ain&rsquo;t going to get no money. It&rsquo;s just like the way it was with the slaves</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it warn&rsquo;t no sale, and the slaves will be back before long. Why, they can&rsquo;t collect the money for the slaves, yet</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they&rsquo;re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run down to breakfast now, and then I&rsquo;ll start straight for Mr. Lothrop&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed, that ain&rsquo;t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;by no manner of means; go before breakfast.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I never thought</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and come to think, I don&rsquo;t know. What was it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s because you ain&rsquo;t one of these leather-face people. I don&rsquo;t want no better book than what your face is. A body can set down and read it off like coarse print. Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles, when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There, there, don&rsquo;t! Yes, I&rsquo;ll go before breakfast</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;ll be glad to. And leave my sisters with them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">never mind about them. They&rsquo;ve got to stand it yet a while. They might suspicion something if all of you was to go. I don&rsquo;t want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning, your face would tell something. No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I&rsquo;ll fix it with all of them. I&rsquo;ll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you&rsquo;ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or to see a friend, and you&rsquo;ll be back tonight or early in the morning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won&rsquo;t have my love given to them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, it sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be.&rdquo; It was well enough to tell her so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">no harm in it. It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it&rsquo;s the little things that smoothes people&rsquo;s roads the most, down here below; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn&rsquo;t cost nothing. Then I says: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one more thing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that bag of money.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how they got it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re out, there. They hain&rsquo;t got it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, who&rsquo;s got it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wish I knowed, but I don&rsquo;t. I had it, because I stole it from them: and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I&rsquo;m afraid it ain&rsquo;t there no more. I&rsquo;m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I&rsquo;m just as sorry as I can be but I done the best I could; I did, honest. I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and it warn&rsquo;t a good place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, stop blaming yourself</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it&rsquo;s too bad to do it, and I won&rsquo;t allow it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you couldn&rsquo;t help it; it wasn&rsquo;t you fault. Where did you hide it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I couldn&rsquo;t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So for a minute I didn&rsquo;t say nothing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">then I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ruther not tell you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don&rsquo;t mind letting me off; but I&rsquo;ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop&rsquo;s, if you want to. Do you reckon that&rsquo;ll do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I wrote: &ldquo;I put it in the coffin. It was in there when you was crying there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It made my eyes water a little, to remember her crying there all by herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her, I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good -bye</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m going to do everything just as you&rsquo;ve told me; and if I don&rsquo;t ever see you again, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ever forget you, and I&rsquo;ll think of you a many and a many a time, and I&rsquo;ll pray for you, too!&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and she was gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Pray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she&rsquo;d take a job that was more nearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">she was just that kind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there warn&rsquo;t no back-down to her, I judge. You may say what you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds like flattery, but it ain&rsquo;t no flattery. And when it comes to beauty</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and goodness too</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">she lays over them all. I hain&rsquo;t ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door; no, I hain&rsquo;t ever seen her since, but I reckon I&rsquo;ve thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if ever I&rsquo;d a thought it would do any good for me to pray for her, blamed if I wouldn&rsquo;t a done it or bust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see her go. When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of them people over on t&rsquo;other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s several; but it&rsquo;s the Proctors, mainly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the name,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;I most forgot it. Well, Miss Mary Jane she told me to tell you she&rsquo;s gone over there in a dreadful hurry</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">one of them&rsquo;s sick.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; leastways I kinder forget; but I think it&rsquo;s</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sakes alive, I hope it ain&rsquo;t Hanner !&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say it,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;but Hanner&rsquo;s the very one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My goodness</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and she so well only last week! Is she took bad?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no name for it. They set up with her all night, Miss Mary Jane said, and they don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll last many hours.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Only think of that, now! What&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mumps.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mumps your granny! They don&rsquo;t set up with people that&rsquo;s got the mumps.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t they? You better bet they do with these mumps. These mumps is different. It&rsquo;s a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s it a new kind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s mixed up with other things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What other things?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and yaller janders, and brain fever, and I don&rsquo;t know what all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My land! And they call it the mumps ?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Miss Mary Jane said.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, what in the nation do they call it the mumps for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, because it is the mumps. That&rsquo;s what it starts with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no sense in it. A body might stump his toe, and take pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull up and say, &lsquo;Why, he stumped his toe. &rsquo; Would ther&rsquo; be any sense in that? No. And ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no sense in this, nuther. Is it ketching?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it ketching ? Why, how you talk. Is a harrow catching?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">in the dark? If you don&rsquo;t hitch onto one tooth, you&rsquo;re bound to on another, ain&rsquo;t you? And you can&rsquo;t get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along, can you? Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow, as you may say</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and it ain&rsquo;t no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to get it hitched on good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s awful, I think,&rdquo; says the hare-lip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Uncle Harvey and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I would. Of course I would. I wouldn&rsquo;t lose no time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, why wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. Hain&rsquo;t your uncles obleeged to get along home to England as fast as they can? And do you reckon they&rsquo;d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves? You know they&rsquo;ll wait for you. So fur, so good. Your uncle Harvey&rsquo;s a preacher, ain&rsquo;t he? Very well, then; is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a ship clerk ?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard? Now you know he ain&rsquo;t. What will he do, then? Why, he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it&rsquo;s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she&rsquo;s got it.&rsquo; But never mind, if you think it&rsquo;s best to tell your uncle Harvey</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane&rsquo;s got it or not? Why, you talk like a muggins.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, anyway, maybe you better tell some of the neighbors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Listen at that, now. You do beat all, for natural stupidness. Can&rsquo;t you see that they&rsquo;d go and tell? Ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no way but just to not tell anybody at all</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, maybe you&rsquo;re right</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">yes, I judge you are right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she&rsquo;s gone out a while, anyway, so he won&rsquo;t be uneasy about her?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. She says, &lsquo;Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I&rsquo;ve run over the river to see Mr.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Mr.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what is the name of that rich family your uncle Peter used to think so much of?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I mean the one that</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can&rsquo;t ever seem to remember them, half the time, somehow. Yes, she said, say she has run over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than anybody else; and she&rsquo;s going to stick to them till they say they&rsquo;ll come, and then, if she ain&rsquo;t too tired, she&rsquo;s coming home; and if she is, she&rsquo;ll be home in the morning anyway. She said, don&rsquo;t say nothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which&rsquo;ll be perfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying the house; I know it, because she told me so, herself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Everything was all right now. The girls wouldn&rsquo;t say nothing because they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor Robinson. I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn&rsquo;t a done it no neater himself. Of course he would a throwed more style into it, but I can&rsquo;t do that very handy, not being brung up to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture, now and then, or a little goody-goody saying, of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing for sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But by-and-by the thing dragged through, and everything was sold. Everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard. So they&rsquo;d got to work that off</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow everything. Well, whilst they was at it, a steamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your opposition line! here&rsquo;s your two sets o&rsquo; heirs to old Peter Wilks</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and you pays your money and you takes your choice!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.jvh1gxkokxs2"><span class="c20 c36">

<a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 29 </a></span></h2>

<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">They was fetching a very nice looking old gentleman along, and a nice looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. And my souls, how the people yelled, and laughed, and kept it up. But I didn’t see no joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any. I reckoned they’d turn pale. But no, nary a pale did they turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that’s googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them newcomers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal people gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side. That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see, straight off, he pronounced like an Englishman, not the king’s way, though the king’s was pretty good, for an imitation. I can’t give the old gent’s words, nor I can’t imitate him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“This is a surprise to me which I wasn’t looking for; and I’ll acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain’t very well fixed to meet it and answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes, he’s broke his arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here, last night in the night by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks’s brother Harvey, and this is his brother William, which can’t hear nor speak — and can’t even make signs to amount to much, now’t he’s only got one hand to work them with. We are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can prove it. But, up till then, I won’t say nothing more, but go to the hotel and wait.”


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and blethers out:


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Broke his arm — very likely ain’t it? — and very convenient, too, for a fraud that’s got to make signs, and hain’t learnt how. Lost their baggage! That’s mighty good! — and mighty ingenious — under the circumstances !”


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or maybe half a dozen. One of these was that doctor; another one was a sharp looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their heads — it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the king now. And when the king got done, this husky up and says:


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when’d you come to this town?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“The day before the funeral, friend,” says the king.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“But what time o’ day?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“In the evenin’ — ’bout an hour er two before sundown.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“How’d you come?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“I come down on the Susan Powell, from Cincinnati.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Well, then, how’d you come to be up at the Pint in the mornin’ —  in a canoe?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“I warn’t up at the Pint in the mornin’.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“It’s a lie.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Preacher be hanged, he’s a fraud and a liar. He was up at the Pint that mornin’. I live up there, don’t I? Well, I was up there, and he was up there. I see him there. He come in a canoe, along with Tim Collins and a boy.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">The doctor he up and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“I reckon I would, but I don’t know. Why, yonder he is, now. I know him perfectly easy.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">It was me he pointed at. The doctor says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Neighbors, I don’t know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if these two ain’t frauds, I am an idiot, that’s all. I think it’s our duty to see that they don’t get away from here till we’ve looked into this thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you. We’ll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t’other couple, and I reckon we’ll find out something before we get through.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king’s friends; so we all started. It was about sundown. The doctor he led me along by the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and fetched in the new couple. First, the doctor says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“I don’t wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they’re frauds, and they may have complices that we don’t know nothing about. If they have, won’t the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks left? It ain’t unlikely. If these men ain’t frauds, they won’t object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they’re all right — ain’t that so?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">Everybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place, right at the outstart. But the king he only looked sorrowful, and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain’t got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation o’ this misable business; but alas, the money ain’t there; you k’n send and see, if you want to.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Where is it, then?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her, I took and hid it inside o’ the straw tick o’ my bed, not wishin’ to bank it for the few days we’d be here, and considerin’ the bed a safe place, we not bein’ used to slaves, and suppos’n’ ’em honest, like servants in England. The slaves stole it the very next mornin’ after I had went downstairs; and when I sold ’em, I hadn’t missed the money yit, so they got clean away with it. My servant here k’n tell you ’bout it gentlemen.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">The doctor and several said “Shucks!” and I see nobody didn’t altogether believe him. One man asked me if I see the slaves steal it. I said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them. That was all they asked me. Then the doctor whirls on me and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Are you English too?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, “Stuff!”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about supper, nor ever seemed to think about it — and so they kept it up, and kept it up; and it was the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. They made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his’n; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t’other one lies. And by-and-by they had me up to tell what I knowed. The king he give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the right side. I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn’t get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Set down, my boy, I wouldn’t strain myself, if I was you. I reckon you ain’t used to lying, it don’t seem to come handy; what you want is practice. You do it pretty awkward.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">I didn’t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off, anyway.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“If you’d been in town at first, Levi Bell — ”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">The king broke in and reached out his hand, and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Why, is this my poor dead brother’s old friend that he’s wrote so often about?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased, and they talked right along a while, and then got to one side and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“That’ll fix it. I’ll take the order and send it, along with your brother’s, and then they’ll know it’s all right.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and then they give the pen to the duke — and then for the first time, the duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn’t read it. The lawyer looked powerful astonished, and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Well, it beats me ” — and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man’s writing, and then them again; and then says “These old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here’s these two’s handwritings, and anybody can see they didn’t write them” (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), “and here’s this old gentleman’s handwriting, and anybody can tell, easy enough, he didn’t write them — fact is, the scratches he makes ain’t properly writing, at all. Now here’s some letters from — ”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">The new old gentleman says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“If you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my brother there — so he copies for me. It’s his hand you’ve got there, not mine.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Well! ” says the lawyer, “this is a state of things. I’ve got some of William’s letters too; so if you’ll get him to write a line or so we can com — ”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“He can’t write with his left hand,” says the old gentleman. “If he could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too. Look at both, please — they’re by the same hand.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">The lawyer done it, and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“I believe it’s so — and if it ain’t so, there’s a heap stronger resemblance than I’d noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well! I thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it’s gone to grass, partly. But anyway, one thing is proved — these two ain’t either of ’em Wilkses” — and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">Well, what do you think? — that muleheaded old fool wouldn’t give in then! Indeed he wouldn’t. Said it warn’t no fair test. Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn’t tried to write — he see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along, till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying, himself  — but pretty soon the new old gentleman broke in, and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“I’ve thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br — helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it. We’re both here.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Peraps this gentleman can tell me what was tatooed on his breast?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">Blamed if the king didn’t have to brace up mighty quick, or he’d a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him so sudden — and mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice — because how was he going to know what was tatooed on the man? He whitened a little; he couldn’t help it; and it was mighty still in there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. Says I to myself, Now he’ll throw up the sponge — there ain’t no more use. Well, did he? A body can’t hardly believe it, but he didn’t. I reckon he thought he’d keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so they’d thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away. Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Mf! It’s a very tough question, ain’t it! Yes, sir, I k’n tell you what’s tatooed on his breast. It’s jest a small, thin, blue arrow — that’s what it is; and if you don’t look clost, you can’t see it. Now what do you say — hey?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his eye lights up like he judged he’d got the king this time, and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“There — you’ve heard what he said! Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks’s breast?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">Both of them spoke up and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“We didn’t see no such mark.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Good!” says the old gentleman. “Now, what you did see on his breast was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P — B — W” — and he marked them that way on a piece of paper. “Come — ain’t that what you saw?”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">Both of them spoke up again, and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“No, we didn’t. We never seen any marks at all.”</p></p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">Well, everybody was in a state of mind, now; and they sings out:


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“The whole bilin’ of ’m ’s frauds! Le’s duck ’em! le’s drown ’em! le’s ride ’em on a rail!” and everybody was whooping at once, and there was a rattling pow-wow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells, and says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Gentlemen — gentlemen ! Hear me just a word — just a single word — if you PLEASE! There’s one way yet — let’s go and dig up the corpse and look.”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">That took them.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch them along, too!”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“We’ll do it!” they all shouted: “and if we don’t find them marks we’ll lynch the whole gang!”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">I was scared, now, I tell you. But there warn’t no getting away, you know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the evening.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">As we went by our house I wished I hadn’t sent Mary Jane out of town; because now if I could tip her the wink, she’d light out and save me, and blow on our dead-beats.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like wild-cats; and to make it more scary, the sky was darking up, and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time, if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. If they didn’t find them —</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">I couldn’t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn’t think about nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist — Hines — and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. He dragged me right along, he was so excited; and I had to run to keep up.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow. And when they got to the grave, they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn’t thought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging, anyway, by the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house a half a mile off, to borrow one. So they dug and dug, like everything; and it got awful dark and the rain started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped it all out, and you couldn’t see nothing at all.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">At last they got out the coffin, and begun to unscrew the lid, and then such another crowding, and shouldering, and shoving as there was, to scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful, pulling and tugging so, and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and somebody sings out:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“By the living jingo, here’s the bag of gold on his breast!”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark, there ain’t nobody can tell.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">

<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew — leastways I had it all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">When I struck the town, I see there warn’t nobody out in the storm, so I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it. No light there; the house all dark — which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn’t know why. But at last, just as I was sailing by, flash comes the light in Mary Jane’s window! and my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn’t ever going to be before me no more in this world. She was the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:17px">The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow; and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasn’t chained, I snatched it and shoved. It was a canoe, and warn’t fastened with nothing but a rope. The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of the river, but I didn’t lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last, I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it. But I didn’t. As I sprung aboard I sung out:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Out with you Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, we’re shut of them!”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">Jim lit out, and was a coming for me with both arms spread, he was so full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning, my heart shot up in my mouth, and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights out of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke, but I says:</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">“Not now — have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! Cut loose and let her slide!”</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">So, in two seconds, away we went, a sliding down the river, and it did seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river and nobody to bother us. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack my heels a few times, I couldn’t help it; but about the third crack, I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well — and held my breath and listened and waited — and sure enough, when the next flash busted out over the water, here they come! — and just a laying to their oars and making their skiff hum! It was the king and the duke.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom:15px; font-size:16px;">So I wilted right down onto the planks, then, and give up; and it was all I could do to keep from crying.</p>

Tired of our company</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">hey?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, your majesty, we warn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">please don&rsquo;t, your majesty!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Quick, then, and tell us what was your idea, or I&rsquo;ll shake the insides out o&rsquo; you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honest, I&rsquo;ll tell you everything, just as it happened, your majesty. The man that had aholt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and whispers, &lsquo;Heel it, now, or they&rsquo;ll hang ye, sure!&rsquo; and I lit out. It didn&rsquo;t seem no good for me to stay</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I couldn&rsquo;t do nothing, and I didn&rsquo;t want to be hung if I could get away. So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or they&rsquo;d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn&rsquo;t alive, now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you coming, you may ask Jim if I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, &ldquo;Oh, yes, it&rsquo;s mighty likely!&rdquo; and shook me up again, and said he reckoned he&rsquo;d drownd me. But the duke says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leggo the boy, you old idiot! Would you a done any different? Did you inquire around for him, when you got loose? I don&rsquo;t remember it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it. But the duke says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You better a blame sight give yourself a good cussing, for you&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s entitled to it most. You hain&rsquo;t done a thing, from the start, that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark. That was bright</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it was right down bully; and it was the thing that saved us. For if it hadn&rsquo;t been for that, they&rsquo;d a jailed us till them Englishmen&rsquo;s baggage come</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and then</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took &rsquo;em to the graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the excited fools hadn&rsquo;t let go all holts and made that rush to get a look, we&rsquo;d a slept in our cravats tonight</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">cravats warranted to wear, too</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">longer than we&rsquo;d need &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They was still a minute</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">thinking</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">then the king says, kind of absent-minded like:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mf! And we reckoned the slaves stole it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That made me squirm!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says the duke, kinder slow, and delibrate, and sarcastic, &ldquo;We did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">After about a half a minute, the king drawls out:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leastways</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke says, the same way:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;On the contrary</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The king kind of ruffles up, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looky here, Bilgewater, what&rsquo;r you referrin&rsquo; to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke says, pretty brisk:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When it comes to that, maybe you&rsquo;ll let me ask, what was you referring to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; says the king, very sarcastic; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">maybe you was asleep, and didn&rsquo;t know what you was about.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke bristles right up, now, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, let up on this cussed nonsense</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">do you take me for a blame&rsquo; fool? Don&rsquo;t you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, sir! I know you do know</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">because you done it yourself!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and the duke went for him. The king sings out:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Take y&rsquo;r hands off!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">leggo my throat!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I take it all back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you just own up, first, that you did hide that money there, intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig it up, and have it all to yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait jest a minute, duke</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">answer me this one question, honest and fair; if you didn&rsquo;t put the money there, say it, and I&rsquo;ll b&rsquo;lieve you, and take back everything I said.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You old scoundrel, I didn&rsquo;t, and you know I didn&rsquo;t. There, now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, I b&rsquo;lieve you. But answer me only jest this one more</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">now don&rsquo;t git mad; didn&rsquo;t you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t care if I did, I didn&rsquo;t do it, anyway. But you not only had it in mind to do it, but you done it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wisht I may never die if I done it, duke, and that&rsquo;s honest. I won&rsquo;t say I warn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to do it, because I was; but you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I mean somebody</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">got in ahead o&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie! You done it, and you got to say you done it, or</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The king begun to gurgle, and then he gasps out:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&rsquo;Nough!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I own up! &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was very glad to hear him say that, it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you ever deny it again, I&rsquo;ll drown you. It&rsquo;s well for you to set there and blubber like a baby</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it&rsquo;s fitten for you, after the way you&rsquo;ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and I a trusting you all the time, like you was my own father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled onto a lot of poor slaves and you never say a word for &rsquo;em. It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to believe that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see, now, why you was so anxious to make up the deffersit</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you wanted to get what money I&rsquo;d got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another, and scoop it all! &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The king says, timid, and still a snuffling:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffersit, it warn&rsquo;t me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dry up! I don&rsquo;t want to hear no more out of you!&rdquo; says the duke. &ldquo;And now you see what you got by it. They&rsquo;ve got all their own money back, and all of ourn but a shekel or two, besides. G&rsquo;long to bed</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and don&rsquo;t you deffersit me no more deffersits, long&rsquo;s you live!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So the king sneaked into the wigwam, and took to his bottle for comfort; and before long the duke tackled his bottle; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got, the lovinger they got; and went off a snoring in each other&rsquo;s arms. They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn&rsquo;t get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring, we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.bedcobn8wpb4"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 31</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We dasn&rsquo;t stop again at any town, for days and days; kept right along down the river. We was down south in the warm weather, now, and a mighty long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the 1imbs like long gray beards. It was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they begun to work the villages again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn&rsquo;t make enough for them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a dancing school; but they didn&rsquo;t know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does; so the first prance they made, the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried a go at yellocution; but they didn&rsquo;t yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing and made them skip out. They tackled missionarying, and mesmerizering, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn&rsquo;t seem to have no luck. So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft, as she floated along, thinking, and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And at last they took a change, and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time. Jim and me got uneasy. We didn&rsquo;t like the look of it. We judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody&rsquo;s house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an agreement that we wouldn&rsquo;t have nothing in the world to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake, and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we hid the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village, named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore, and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (&ldquo;House to rob, you mean,&rdquo; says I to myself; &ldquo;and when you get through robbing it you&rsquo;ll come back here and wonder what&rsquo;s become of me and Jim and the raft</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and you&rsquo;ll have to take it out in wondering.&rdquo;) And he said if he warn&rsquo;t back by midday, the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So we staid where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we couldn&rsquo;t seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing. Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come and no king; we could have a change, anyway</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and maybe a chance for the change, on top of it. So me and the duke went up to the village, and hunted around there for the king, and by-and-by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers bullyraggiug him for sport, and he a cussing and threatening with all his might, and so tight he couldn&rsquo;t walk, and couldn&rsquo;t do nothing to them. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king begun to sass back; and the minute they was fairly at it, I lit out, and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again. I got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Set her loose, Jim, we&rsquo;re all right, now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But there warn&rsquo;t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was gone! I set up a shout</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and then another</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and then another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn&rsquo;t no use</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">old Jim was gone. Then I set down and cried; I couldn&rsquo;t help it. But I couldn&rsquo;t set still long. Pretty soon I went out on the road, trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and asked him if he&rsquo;d seen a strange slave, dressed so and so, and he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wherebouts?&rdquo; says I.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Down to Silas Phelps&rsquo;s place, two mile below here. He&rsquo;s a runaway slave, and they&rsquo;ve got him. Was you looking for him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You bet I ain&rsquo;t! I run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago, and he said if I hollered he&rsquo;d cut my livers out</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and told me to lay down and stay where I was; and I done it. Been there ever since; afeard to come out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t be afeard no more, becuz they&rsquo;ve got him. He run off f&rsquo;m down South, som&rsquo;ers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good job they got him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I reckon! There&rsquo;s two hunderd dollars reward on him. It&rsquo;s like picking up money out&rsquo;n the road.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, it is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and I could a had it if I&rsquo;d been big enough; I see him first. Who nailed him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was an old fellow</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">a stranger</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars, becuz he&rsquo;s got to go up the river and can&rsquo;t wait. Think o&rsquo; that, now! You bet I&rsquo;d wait, if it was seven year.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me, every time,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;But maybe his chance ain&rsquo;t worth no more than that, if he&rsquo;ll sell it so cheap. Maybe there&rsquo;s something ain&rsquo;t straight about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But it is, though</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">straight as a string. I see the handbill myself. It tells all about him, to a dot</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">paints him like a picture, and tells the plantation he&rsquo;s frum, below Newrleans. No-sirree-bob</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;they ain&rsquo;t no trouble &rsquo;bout that speculation, you bet you. Say, gimine a chaw tobacker, won&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t have none, so he left. I went to the raft, and set down in the wigwam to think. But I couldn&rsquo;t come to nothing. I thought till I wore my head sore, but I couldn&rsquo;t see no way out of the trouble. After all this long journey, and after all we&rsquo;d done for them scoundrels, here was it all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty dirty dollars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he&rsquo;d got to be a slave, and so I&rsquo;d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was. But I soon give up that notion, for two things: she&rsquo;d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she&rsquo;d sell him straight down the river again; and if she didn&rsquo;t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful slave, and they&rsquo;d make Jim feel it all the time, and so he&rsquo;d feel ornery and disgraced. And then think of me! It would get all around, that Huck Finn helped a slave to get his freedom; and if I was to ever see anybody from that town again, I&rsquo;d be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame. That&rsquo;s just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he don&rsquo;t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide it, it ain&rsquo;t no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this, the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman&rsquo;s slave that hadn&rsquo;t ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there&rsquo;s One that&rsquo;s always on the lookout, and ain&rsquo;t agoing to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared. Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself, by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn&rsquo;t so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, &ldquo;There was the Sunday school, you could a gone to it; and if you&rsquo;d a done it they&rsquo;d a learnt you, there, that people that acts as I&rsquo;d been acting about that slave goes to everlasting fire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray; and see if I couldn&rsquo;t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was, and be better. So I kneeled down. But the words wouldn&rsquo;t come. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they? It warn&rsquo;t no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from me, neither. I knowed very well why they wouldn&rsquo;t come. It was because my heart warn&rsquo;t right; it was because I warn&rsquo;t square; it was because I was playing double. I was letting on to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my mouth say I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write to that slave&rsquo;s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I knowed it was a lie</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and He knowed it. You can&rsquo;t pray a lie</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I found that out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn&rsquo;t know what to do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I&rsquo;ll go and write the letter</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and then see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as light as a feather, right straight off, and my troubles all gone. So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Miss Watson your runaway slave Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send. HUCK FINN.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn&rsquo;t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me, all the time, in the day, and in the nighttime, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a floating along, talking, and singing, and laughing. But somehow I couldn&rsquo;t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I&rsquo;d see him standing my watch on top of his&rsquo;n, stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me, and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he&rsquo;s got now; and then I happened to look around, and see that paper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a trembling, because I&rsquo;d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, then, I&rsquo;ll go to hell&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and tore it up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was awful thoughts, and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head; and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn&rsquo;t. And for a starter, I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps&rsquo;s place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it, &ldquo;Phelps&rsquo;s Sawmill,&rdquo; and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn&rsquo;t see nobody around, though it was good daylight, now. But I didn&rsquo;t mind, because I didn&rsquo;t want to see nobody just yet</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I only wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see, when I got there, was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">three-night performance</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him, before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hel-lo ! Where&rsquo;d you come from?&rdquo; Then he says, kind of glad and eager, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the raft?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">got her in a good place?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s just what I was agoing to ask your grace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he didn&rsquo;t look so joyful</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What was your idea for asking me?&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;when I see the king in that doggery yesterday, I says to myself, we can&rsquo;t get him home for hours, till he&rsquo;s soberer; so I went a loafing around town to put in the time, and wait. A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me aholt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me, and jerked loose and run, and we after him. We didn&rsquo;t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark, then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, &lsquo;they&rsquo;ve got into trouble and had to leave; and they&rsquo;ve took my slave, which is the only slave I&rsquo;ve got in the world, and now I&rsquo;m in a strange country, and ain&rsquo;t got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;&rsquo; so I set down and cried. I slept in the woods all night. But what did become of the raft then?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and Jim, poor Jim!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Blamed if I know</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that is, what&rsquo;s become of the raft. That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half dollars with him and got every cent but what he&rsquo;d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone, we said, &lsquo;That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and run off down the river.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t shake my slave, would I?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the only slave I had in the world, and the only property.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we&rsquo;d come to consider him our slave; yes, we did consider him so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">goodness knows we had trouble enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone, and we flat broke, there warn&rsquo;t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake. And I&rsquo;ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where&rsquo;s that ten cents? Give it here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the money I had, and I hadn&rsquo;t had nothing to eat since yesterday. He never said nothing. The next minute he whirls on me and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you reckon that slave would blow on us? We&rsquo;d skin him if he done that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How can he blow? Hain&rsquo;t he run off?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No! That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sold him?&rdquo; I says, and begun to cry; &ldquo;why, he was my slave, and that was my money. Where is he?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I want my slave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t get your slave, that&rsquo;s all</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">so dry up your blubbering. Looky here</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">do you think you&rsquo;d venture to blow on us? Blamed if I think I&rsquo;d trust you. Why, if you was to blow on us</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to blow on nobody; and I ain&rsquo;t got no time to blow, nohow. I got to turn out and find my slave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you&rsquo;ll promise you won&rsquo;t blow, and won&rsquo;t let the slave blow, I&rsquo;ll tell you where to find him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I promised, and he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A farmer by the name of Silas Ph</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo; and then he stopped. You see he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped, that way, and begun to study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind. And so he was. He wouldn&rsquo;t trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days. So pretty soon he says: &ldquo;The man that bought him is named Abram Foster</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Abram G. Foster</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and he lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I can walk it in three days. And I&rsquo;ll start this very afternoon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No you won&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll start now; and don&rsquo;t you lose any time about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along, and then you won&rsquo;t get into trouble with us, d&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I wanted to be left free to work my plans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So clear out,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim is your slave</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">some idiots don&rsquo;t require documents</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">leastways I&rsquo;ve heard there&rsquo;s such down South here. And when you tell him the handbill and the reward&rsquo;s bogus, maybe he&rsquo;ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting &rsquo;em out. Go &rsquo;long, now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind you don&rsquo;t work your jaw any between here and there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I left, and struck for the back country. I didn&rsquo;t look around, but I kinder felt like he was watching me. But I knowed I could tire him out at that. I went straight out in the country as much as a mile, before I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps&rsquo;s. I reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off, without fooling around, because I wanted to stop Jim&rsquo;s mouth till these fellows could get away. I didn&rsquo;t want no trouble with their kind. I&rsquo;d seen all I wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.okfz3th96m0m"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 32</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody&rsquo;s dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves, it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it&rsquo;s spirits whispering</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">spirits that&rsquo;s been dead ever so many years</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and you always think they&rsquo;re talking about you</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;As a general thing it makes a body wish he was dead, too, and done with it all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Phelps&rsquo;s was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations; and they all look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile, made out of logs sawed off and up-ended, in steps, like barrels of a different length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump onto a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big double log house for the white folks</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">hewed logs, with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house back of the kitchen; three little log slave-cabins in a row t&rsquo;other side the smokehouse; one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper, and big kettle to bile soap in, by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there, in the sun; more hounds asleep, round about; about three shade-trees away off in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a water-melon patch; then the cotton fields begins; and after the fields, the woods.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started for the kitchen. When I got a little ways, I heard the dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">for that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for I&rsquo;d noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth, if I left it alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still. And such another pow-wow as they made! In a quarter of a minute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel, as you may say</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">spokes made out of dogs</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">circle of fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses stretched up towards me, a barking and howling; and more a coming; you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A slave woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her hand, singing out, &ldquo;Begone! you Tige! you Spot! begone, sah!&rdquo; and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent him howling, and then the rest followed; and the next second, half of them come back, wagging their tails around me and making friends with me. There ain&rsquo;t no harm in a hound, nohow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And behind the woman comes a little slave girl and two little slave boys, without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung onto their mother&rsquo;s gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way they always do. And here comes the white woman running from the house, about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the same way the little slaves was doing. She was smiling all over so she could hardly stand</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, at last!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I out with a &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; before I thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and she couldn&rsquo;t seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would, but law sakes, I don&rsquo;t care for that, I&rsquo;m so glad to see you! Dear, dear, it does seem like I could eat you up! Childern, it&rsquo;s your cousin Tom!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">tell him howdy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and hid behind her. So she run on:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast, right away</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">or did you get your breakfast on the boat?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I said I had got it on the boat. So then she started for the house, leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after. When we got there, she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now I can have a good look at you; and laws-a-me, I&rsquo;ve been hungry for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it&rsquo;s come at last!

What&rsquo;s kep&rsquo; you?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">boat get aground?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">she</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say yes&rsquo;m</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">say Aunt Sally. Where&rsquo;d she get aground?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t rightly know what to say, because I didn&rsquo;t know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down. But I go a good deal on instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">from down towards Orleans. That did&rsquo;nt help me much, though; for I didn&rsquo;t know the names of bars down that way. I see I&rsquo;d got to invent a bar, or forget the name of the one we got aground on</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">or</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Now I struck an idea, and fetched it out:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It warn&rsquo;t the grounding</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that didn&rsquo;t keep us back but a little. We blowed out a cylinder-head.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good gracious! anybody hurt?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No&rsquo;m. Killed a slave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. Two years ago last Christmas, your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man. And I think he died afterwards. He was a Babtist. Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well. Yes, I remember, now he did die. Mortification set in, and they had to amputate him. But it didn&rsquo;t save him. Yes, it was mortification</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that was it. He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a sight to look at. Your uncle&rsquo;s been up to the town every day to fetch you. And he&rsquo;s gone again, not more&rsquo;n an hour ago; he&rsquo;ll be back any minute, now. You must a met him on the road, didn&rsquo;t you?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">oldish man, with a</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boat landed just at daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too soon; and so I come down the back way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d you give the baggage to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nobody.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, child, it&rsquo;ll be stole!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not where I hid it I reckon it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was kinder thin ice, but I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers&rsquo; lunch, and give me all I wanted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was getting so uneasy I couldn&rsquo;t listen good. I had my mind on the children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side, and pump them a little, and find out who I was. But I couldn&rsquo;t get no show, Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so. Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back, because she says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But here we&rsquo;re a running on this way, and you hain&rsquo;t told me a word about Sis, nor any of them. Now I&rsquo;ll rest my works a little, and you start up yourn; just tell me everything</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;tell me all about &rsquo;m all</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">every one of &rsquo;m; and how they are, and what they&rsquo;re doing, and what they told you to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, I see I was up a stump</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and up it good. Providence had stood by me this fur, all right, but I was hard and tight aground, now. I see it warn&rsquo;t a bit of use to try to go ahead</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d got to throw up my hand. So I says to myself, here&rsquo;s another place where I got to resk the truth. I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here he comes! stick your head down lower</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there, that&rsquo;ll do; you can&rsquo;t be seen, now. Don&rsquo;t you let on you&rsquo;re here. I&rsquo;ll play a joke on him. Childern, don&rsquo;t you say a word.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I see I was in a fix, now. But it warn&rsquo;t no use to worry; there warn&rsquo;t nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in, then the bed hid him. Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Has he come?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says her husband.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good-ness gracious!&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;what in the world can have become of him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; says the old gentleman; &ldquo;and I must say, it makes me dreadful uneasy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Uneasy!&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to go distracted! He must a come; and you&rsquo;ve missed him along the road. I know it&rsquo;s so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">something tells me so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why Sally, I couldn&rsquo;t miss him along the road</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you know that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But oh, dear, dear, what will Sis say! He must a come! You must a missed him. He</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t distress me any more&rsquo;n I&rsquo;m already distressed. I don&rsquo;t know what in the world to make of it. I&rsquo;m at my wit&rsquo;s end, and I don&rsquo;t mind acknowledging &rsquo;t I&rsquo;m right down scared. But there&rsquo;s no hope that he&rsquo;s come; for he couldn&rsquo;t come and me miss him. Sally, it&rsquo;s terrible</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">just terrible</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">something&rsquo;s happened to the boat, sure!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Silas! Look yonder!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">up the road!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">ain&rsquo;t that somebody coming?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs. Phelps the chance she wanted. She stooped down quick, at the foot of the bed, and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the window, there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside. The old gentleman stared, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who do you reckon &rsquo;t is?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I haint no idea. Who is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Tom Sawyer! &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">By jings, I most slumped though the floor. But there warn&rsquo;t no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on shaking; and all the time, how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of the tribe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But if they was joyful, it warn&rsquo;t nothing to what I was; for it was like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. Well, they froze to me for two hours; and at last when my chin was so tired it couldn&rsquo;t hardly go, any more, I had told them more about my family</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I mean the Sawyer family</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">than ever happened to any six Sawyer families. And I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White River and it took us three days to fix it. Which was all right, and worked first rate; because they didn&rsquo;t know but what it would take three days to fix it. If I&rsquo;d a called it a bolt-head it would a done just as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty uncomfortable all up the other. Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable; and it stayed easy and comfortable till by-and-by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">then I says to myself, spose Tom Sawyer come down on that boat?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and spose he steps in here, any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet? Well, I couldn&rsquo;t have it that way</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it wouldn&rsquo;t do at all. I must go up the road and waylay him. So I told the folks I reckoned I would up to the town and fetch down my baggage. The old gentleman was for going along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and I druther he wouldn&rsquo;t take no trouble about me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.pjt5hbwwqwc6"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 33</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I started for town, in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a wagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and waited till he come along. I says &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; and it stopped alongside, and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and staid so; and he swallowed two or three times like a person that&rsquo;s got a dry throat, and then says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t ever done you no harm. You know that. So then, what you want to come back and ha&rsquo;nt me for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t come back</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I hain&rsquo;t been gone</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When he heard my voice, it righted him up some, but he warn&rsquo;t quite satisfied yet. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn&rsquo;t on you. Honest, now, you ain&rsquo;t a ghost?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Honest, I ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can&rsquo;t somehow seem to understand it, no way. Looky here, warn&rsquo;t you ever murdered at all ?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. I warn&rsquo;t ever murdered at all</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I played it on them. You come in here and feel of me if you don&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me again, he didn&rsquo;t know what to do. And he wanted to know all about it right off; because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it hit him where he lived. But I said, leave it alone till by-and-by; and told his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told him the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do? He said, let him alone a minute, and don&rsquo;t disturb him. So he thought and thought, and pretty soon he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, I&rsquo;ve got it. Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on it&rsquo;s your&rsquo;n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the house about the time you ought to; and I&rsquo;ll go towards town a piece, and take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you; and you needn&rsquo;t let on to know me, at first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right; but wait a minute. There&rsquo;s one more thing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">a thing that nobody don&rsquo;t know but me. And that is, there&rsquo;s a slave here that I&rsquo;m a trying to steal out of slavery</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and his name is Jim </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">old Miss Watson&rsquo;s Jim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What! Why Jim is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He stopped and went to studying. I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;ll say. You&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s dirty low-down business; but what if it is?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I &rsquo;m low down; and I&rsquo;m agoing to steal him, and I want you to keep mum and not let on. Will you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">His eye lit up, and he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you steal him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. It was the most astonishing speech I ever heard</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and I&rsquo;m bound to say Tom Sawyer fell, considerable, in my estimation. Only I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Tom Sawyer a slave stealer!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, shucks,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re joking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t joking, either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;joking or no joking, if you hear anything said about a runaway slave, don&rsquo;t forget to remember that you don&rsquo;t know nothing about him, and I don&rsquo;t know nothing about him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his way, and I drove mine. But of course I forgot all about driving slow, on accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip. The old gentleman was at the door, and he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, this is wonderful. Who ever would a thought it was in that mare to do it. I wish we&rsquo;d a timed her. And she hain&rsquo;t sweated a hair</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">not a hair. It&rsquo;s wonderful. Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t take a hunderd dollars for that horse now; I wouldn&rsquo;t, honest; and yet I&rsquo;d a sold her for fifteen before, and thought &rsquo;twas all she was worth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s all he said. He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see. But it warn&rsquo;t surprising; because he warn&rsquo;t only just a farmer, he was a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church and school-house, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was worth it, too. There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and done the same way, down South.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In about half an hour Tom&rsquo;s wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt Sally she see it through the window because it was only about fifty yards, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s somebody come! I wonder who &rsquo;tis? Why, I do believe it&rsquo;s a stranger. Jimmy&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s one of the children), &ldquo;run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger don&rsquo;t come every year, and so he lays over the yaller fever, for interest, when he does come. Tom was over the stile and starting for the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we was all bunched in the front door. Tom had his store clothes on, and an audience</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer. In them circumstances it warn&rsquo;t no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable. He warn&rsquo;t a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no, he come ca&rsquo;m and important, like the ram. When he got afront of us, he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn&rsquo;t want to disturb them, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, my boy,&rdquo; says the old gentleman, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say &lsquo;t your driver has deceived you; Nichols&rsquo;s place is down a matter of three mile more. Come in, come in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, &ldquo;Too late</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">he&rsquo;s out of sight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with us; and then we&rsquo;ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t make you so much trouble; I couldn&rsquo;t think of it. I&rsquo;ll walk</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t mind the distance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t let you walk</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it wouldn&rsquo;t be Southern hospitality to do it. Come right in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, do,&rdquo; says Aunt Sally; &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t a bit of trouble to us, not a bit in the world. You must stay. It&rsquo;s a long, dusty three mile, and we can&rsquo;t let you walk. And besides, I&rsquo;ve already told &rsquo;em to put on another plate, when I see you coming; so you mustn&rsquo;t disappoint us. Come right in, and make yourself at home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be persuaded, and come in; and when he was in, he said he was a stranger from Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and he made another bow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervous, and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last, still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth, and then settled back again in his chair, comfortable, and was going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You owdacious puppy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He looked kind of hurt, and says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at you, m&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re s&rsquo;rp</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Why, what do you reckon I am? I&rsquo;ve a good notion to take and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">say, what do you mean by kissing me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He looked kind of humble, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean nothing, m&rsquo;am. I didn&rsquo;t mean no harm. I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">thought you&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, you born fool!&rdquo; She took up the spinning-stick, and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it. &ldquo;What.made you think I&rsquo;d like it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. Only, they</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">told me you would.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They told you I would. Whoever told you&rsquo;s another lunatic. I never heard the beat of it. Who&rsquo;s they ?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">everybody. They all said so, m&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s &lsquo;everybody?&rsquo; Out with their names</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">or ther&rsquo;ll be an idiot short.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, and I warn&rsquo;t expecting it. They told me to. They all told me to. They all said kiss her; and said she&rsquo;ll like it. They all said it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">every one of them. But I&rsquo;m sorry, m&rsquo;am, and I won&rsquo;t do it no more</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I won&rsquo;t, honest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t, won&rsquo;t you? Well, I sh&rsquo;d reckon you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m honest about it; I won&rsquo;t ever do it again. Till you ask me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Till I ask you! Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days! I lay you&rsquo;ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">or the likes of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;it does surprise me so. I can&rsquo;t make it out, somehow. They said you would, and I thought you would. But</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo; He stopped and looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye, somewhere&rsquo;s; and fetched up on the old gentleman&rsquo;s, and says, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you think she&rsquo;d like me to kiss her, sir?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, no, I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">well, no, I b&rsquo;lieve I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he looks on around, the same way, to me</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tom, didn&rsquo;t you think Aunt Sally&rsquo;d open out her arms and say, &lsquo;Sid Sawyer</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My land!&rdquo; she says, breaking in and jumping for him, &ldquo;you impudent young rascal, to fool a body so</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo; and was going to hug him, but he fended her off, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, not till you&rsquo;ve asked me, first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So she didn&rsquo;t lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed him, over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he took what was left. And after they got a little quiet again, she says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. We warn&rsquo;t looking for you, at all, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because it warn&rsquo;t intended for any of us to come but Tom,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me to by-and-by tag along and drop in and let on to be a stranger. But it was a mistake, Aunt Sally. This ain&rsquo;t no healthy place for a stranger to come.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">not impudent whelps, Sid. You ought to had your jaws boxed; I hain&rsquo;t been so put out since I don&rsquo;t know when. But I don&rsquo;t care, I don&rsquo;t mind the terms</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here. Well, to think of that performance! I don&rsquo;t deny it, I was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven families</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and all hot, too; none of your flabby tough meat that&rsquo;s laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning. Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn&rsquo;t cool it a bit, neither, the way I&rsquo;ve seen them kind of interruptions do, lots of times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was a considerable good deal of talk, all the afternoon, and me and Tom was on the lookout all the time, but it warn&rsquo;t no use, they didn&rsquo;t happen to say nothing about any runaway slave, and we was afraid to try to work up to it. But at supper, at night, one of the little boys says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pa, mayn&rsquo;t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says the old man, &ldquo;I reckon there ain&rsquo;t going to be any; and, you couldn&rsquo;t go if there was; because the runaway slave told Burton and me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the people; so I reckon they&rsquo;ve drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So there it was!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but I couldn&rsquo;t help it. Tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid goodnight and went up to bed, right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn&rsquo;t believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so, if I didn&rsquo;t hurry up and give them one they&rsquo;d get into trouble sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered, and how pap disappeared, pretty soon, and didn&rsquo;t come back no more, and what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft-voyage as I had time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the middle of it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it was as much as half-after eight, then</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">here comes a raging rush of people, with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by; and as they went by, I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that is, I knowed it was the king and the duke, though they was all over tar and feathers, and didn&rsquo;t look like nothing in the world that was human</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes. Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn&rsquo;t ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world. It was a dreadful thing to see. Human beings can be awful cruel to one another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We see we was too late</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">couldn&rsquo;t do no good. We asked some stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and the house rose up and went for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So we poked along back home, and I warn&rsquo;t feeling so brash as I was before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">though I hadn&rsquo;t done nothing. But that&rsquo;s always the way; it don&rsquo;t make no difference whether you do right or wrong, a person&rsquo;s conscience ain&rsquo;t got no sense, and just goes for him anyway. If I had a yaller dog that didn&rsquo;t know no more than a person&rsquo;s conscience does, I would pison him. It takes up more room than all the rest of a person&rsquo;s insides, and yet ain&rsquo;t no good, nohow. Tom Sawyer he says the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.r2x3j93h5dy4"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 34</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We stopped talking, and got to thinking. By-and-by Tom says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looky here, Huck, what fools we are, to not think of it before! I bet I know where Jim is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No! Where?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at dinner, didn&rsquo;t you see a slave man go in there with some vittles?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you think the vittles was for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For a dog.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So&rsquo;d I. Well, it wasn&rsquo;t for a dog.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because part of it was watermelon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So it was</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I noticed it. Well, it does beat all, that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can see and don&rsquo;t see at the same time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, the slave unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it again when he come out. He fetched uncle a key, about the time we got up from table</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain&rsquo;t likely there&rsquo;s two prisoners on such a little plantation, and where the people&rsquo;s all so kind and good. Jim&rsquo;s the prisoner. All right</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I&rsquo;m glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn&rsquo;t give shucks for any other way. Now you work your mind and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we&rsquo;ll take the one we like the best.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">What a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer&rsquo;s head, I wouldn&rsquo;t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from. Pretty soon, Tom says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">bring it out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My plan is this,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;We can easy find out if it&rsquo;s Jim in there. Then get up my canoe tomorrow night, and fetch my raft over from the island. Then the first dark night that comes, steal the key out of the old man&rsquo;s britches, after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river on the raft, with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before. Wouldn&rsquo;t that plan work?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Work ? Why cert&rsquo;nly, it would work, like rats a fighting. But it&rsquo;s too blame&rsquo; simple; there ain&rsquo;t nothing to it. What&rsquo;s the good of a plan that ain&rsquo;t no more trouble than that? It&rsquo;s as mild as goose-milk. Why, Huck, it wouldn&rsquo;t make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I never said nothing, because I warn&rsquo;t expecting nothing different; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldn&rsquo;t have none of them objections to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And it didn&rsquo;t. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine, for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it. I needn&rsquo;t tell what it was, here, because I knowed it wouldn&rsquo;t stay the way it was. I knowed he would be changing it around, every which way, as we went along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what he done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, one thing was dead sure; and that was, that Tom Sawyer was in earnest and was actuly going to help steal that slave out of slavery. That was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy that was respectable, and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was, without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before everybody. I couldn&rsquo;t understand it, no way at all. It was outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was, and save himself. And I did start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you reckon I know what I&rsquo;m about? Don&rsquo;t I generly know what I&rsquo;m about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say I was going to help steal the slave?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s all he said, and that&rsquo;s all I said. It warn&rsquo;t no use to say any more; because when he said he&rsquo;d do a thing, he always done it. But I couldn&rsquo;t make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just let it go, and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to have it so, I couldn&rsquo;t help it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When we got home, the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to the hut by the ash-hopper, for to examine it. We went through the yard, so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn&rsquo;t make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night. When we got to the cabin, we took a look at the front and the two sides; and on the side I warn&rsquo;t acquainted with</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">which was the north side</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it. I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the ticket. This hole&rsquo;s big enough for Jim to get through, if we wrench off the board.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tom says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing hooky. I should hope we can find a way that&rsquo;s a little more complicated than that, Huck Finn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;how&rsquo;ll it do to saw him out, the way I done before I was murdered, that time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;it&rsquo;s real mysterious, and troublesome, and good,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;but I bet we can find a way that&rsquo;s twice as long. There ain&rsquo;t no hurry; le&rsquo;s keep on looking around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to, that joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long as the hut, but narrow</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">only about six foot wide. The door to it was at the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the soap kettle, and searched around and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with; so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match, and see the shed was only built against the cabin and hadn&rsquo;t no connection with it; and there warn&rsquo;t no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes, and spades, and picks, and a crippled plow. The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re all right We&rsquo;ll dig him out. It&rsquo;ll take about a week!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you only have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don&rsquo;t fasten the doors</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but that warn&rsquo;t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer: no way would do him but he must climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half-way about three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most busted his brains out, he thought he&rsquo;d got to give it up; but after he was rested, he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this time he made the trip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the slave cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the slave that fed Jim</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">if it was Jim that was being fed. The slaves was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim&rsquo;s slave was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">This slave had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off. He said the witches was pestering him awful, these nights, and making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn&rsquo;t believe he was ever witched so long, before, in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his troubles, he forgot all about what he&rsquo;d been agoing to do. So Tom says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the vittles for ? Going to feed the dogs?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The slave kind of smiled around graduly over his face, like when you heave a brickbat in a mud puddle, and he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Mars Sid, a dog. Cur&rsquo;us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at &rsquo;im?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I hunched Tom, and whispers:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You going, right here in the day-break? That warn&rsquo;t the plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it warn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but it&rsquo;s the plan now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So, drat him, we went along, but I didn&rsquo;t like it much. When we got in, we couldn&rsquo;t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Huck! En good lan&rsquo;! ain&rsquo; dat Misto Tom?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn&rsquo;t know nothing to do; and if I had, I couldn&rsquo;t a done it; because that slave busted in and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genimen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We could see pretty well, now. Tom he looked at the slave, steady and kind of wondering, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does who know us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, dish-yer runaway slave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What put it dar? Didn&rsquo; he jis&rsquo; dis minute sing out like he knowed you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s mighty curious. Who sung out? When did he sing out? What did he sing out?&rdquo; And turns to me, perfectly c&rsquo;am, and says, &ldquo;Did you hear anybody sing out?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Of course there warn&rsquo;t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says &ldquo;No; I ain&rsquo;t heard nobody say nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before; and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you sing out?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&lsquo;&lsquo;No, sah,&rdquo; says Jim; &ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t said nothing, sah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not a word?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, sah, I hain&rsquo;t said a word.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you ever see us before?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, sah; not as I knows on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So Tom turns to the slave, which was looking wild and distressed, and says, kind of severe:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you reckon&rsquo;s the matter with you, anyway? What made you think somebody sung out?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s de dad-blame&rsquo; witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. Dey&rsquo;s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos&rsquo; kill me, dey sk&rsquo;yers me so. Please to don&rsquo;t tell nobody &rsquo;bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he&rsquo;ll scole me; &rsquo;kase he say dey ain&rsquo;t no witches. I jis&rsquo; wish to goodness he was heah now</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">den what would he say! I jis&rsquo; bet he couldn&rsquo; fine no way to git aroun&rsquo; it dis time. But it&rsquo;s awluz jis&rsquo; so; people dat&rsquo;s sot, stays sot; dey won&rsquo;t look into nothn&rsquo; en fine it out f&rsquo;r deyselves, en when you fine it out en tell um &rsquo;bout it, dey doan&rsquo; b&rsquo;lieve you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn&rsquo;t tell nobody; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this slave. If I was to catch a slave that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn&rsquo;t give him up, I&rsquo;d hang him.&rdquo; And whilst the slave stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on nights, it&rsquo;s us: we&rsquo;re going to set you free.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it, then the slave come back, and we said we&rsquo;d come again some time if the slave wanted us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks around then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.ipme1mbvnflz"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 35</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It would be most an hour, yet, till breakfast, so we left, and struck down into the woods; because Tom said we got to have some light to see how to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that&rsquo;s called fox-fire and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place. We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be. And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan. There ain&rsquo;t no watchman to be drugged</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">now there ought to be a watchman. There ain&rsquo;t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. And there&rsquo;s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed slave, and don&rsquo;t send nobody to watch the slave. Jim could a got out of that window hole before this, only there wouldn&rsquo;t be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat it, Huck, it&rsquo;s the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent all the difficulties. Well, we can&rsquo;t help it, we got to do the best we can with the materials we&rsquo;ve got. Anyhow, there&rsquo;s one thing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there&rsquo;s more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where there warn&rsquo;t one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own head. Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got to let on that a lantern&rsquo;s resky. Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to, I believe. Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of, the first chance we get.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do we want of a saw?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do we want of it? Hain&rsquo;t we got to saw the leg of Jim&rsquo;s bed off, so as to get the chain loose?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, if that ain&rsquo;t just like you, Huck Finn. You can get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. Why, hain&rsquo;t you ever read any books at all?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny, nor Henri IV, nor none of them heroes? Whoever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? No; the way all the best authorities does, is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can&rsquo;t be found, and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal [seneschal] can&rsquo;t see no sign of it&rsquo;s being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound. Then, the night you&rsquo;re ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip off your chain, and there you are. Nothing to do but hitch your rope-ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">because a rope-ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and there&rsquo;s your horses and your trusty vassles [vassals], and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle and away you go, to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is. It&rsquo;s gaudy, Huck. I wish there was a moat to this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we&rsquo;ll dig one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do we want of a moat, when we&rsquo;re going to snake him out from under the cabin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But he never heard me. He had forgot me and everything else. He had his chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon, he sighs, and shakes his head; then sighs again, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it wouldn&rsquo;t do</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there ain&rsquo;t necessity enough for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; I says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, to saw Jim&rsquo;s leg off,&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Good land!&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;why, there ain&rsquo;t no necessity for it. And what would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, some of the best authorities has done it. They couldn&rsquo;t get the chain off, so they just cut their hand off, and shoved. And a leg would be better still. But we got to let that go. There ain&rsquo;t necessity enough in this case; and besides, Jim&rsquo;s a slave and wouldn&rsquo;t understand the reasons for it, and how it&rsquo;s the custom in Europe; so we&rsquo;ll let it go. But there&rsquo;s one thing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">he can have a rope-ladder; we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope-ladder easy enough. And we can send it to him in a pie; it&rsquo;s mostly done that way. And I&rsquo;ve et worse pies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;Jim ain&rsquo;t got no use for a rope-ladder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He has got use for it. How you talk, you better say; you don&rsquo;t know nothing about it. He&rsquo;s got to have a rope ladder; they all do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What in the nation can he do with it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do with it? He can hide it in his bed, can&rsquo;t he? That&rsquo;s what they all do; and he&rsquo;s got to, too. Huck, you don&rsquo;t ever seem to want to do anything that&rsquo;s regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the time. Spose he don&rsquo;t do nothing with it? ain&rsquo;t it there in his bed, for a clew, after he&rsquo;s gone? and don&rsquo;t you reckon they&rsquo;ll want clews? Of course they will. And you wouldn&rsquo;t leave them any? That would be a pretty howdy-do, wouldn&rsquo; t it! I never heard of such a thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s in the regulations, and he&rsquo;s got to have it, all right, let him have it; because I don&rsquo;t wish to go back on no regulations; but there&rsquo;s one thing, Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">if we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope-ladder, we&rsquo;re going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you&rsquo;re born. Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark ladder don&rsquo;t cost nothing, and don&rsquo;t waste nothing, and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain&rsquo;t had no experience, and so he don&rsquo;t care what kind of a</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you, I&rsquo;d keep still</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do. Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder? Why, it&rsquo;s perfectly ridiculous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you&rsquo;ll take my advice, you&rsquo;ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothes-line.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He said that would do. And that give him another idea, and he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Borrow a shirt, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do we want of a shirt, Tom?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Journal your granny</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Jim can&rsquo;t write.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Spose he can&rsquo;t write</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">he can make marks on the shirt, can&rsquo;t he, if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel-hoop?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one; and quicker, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Prisoners don&rsquo;t have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens out of, you muggins. They always make their pens out of the hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks and weeks, and months and months to file it out, too, because they&rsquo;ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall. They wouldn&rsquo;t use a goose-quill if they had it. It ain&rsquo;t regular.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, what&rsquo;ll we make him the ink out of?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that&rsquo;s the common sort and women; the best authorities uses their own blood. Jim can do that; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he&rsquo;s captivated, he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window. The Iron Mask always done that, and it&rsquo;s a blame&rsquo; good way, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jim ain&rsquo;t got no tin plates. They feed him in a pan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t anything; we can get him some.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t nobody read his plates.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t got nothing to do with it, Huck Finn. All he&rsquo;s got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out. You don&rsquo;t have to be able to read it. Why, half the time you can&rsquo;t read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, what&rsquo;s the sense in wasting the plates?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, blame it all, it ain&rsquo;t the prisoner&rsquo;s plates.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But it&rsquo;s somebody&rsquo;s plates, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, spos&rsquo;n it is? What does the prisoner care whose</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. So we cleared out for the house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Along during that morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing, because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn&rsquo;t borrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing prisoners; and prisoners don&rsquo;t care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody don&rsquo;t blame them for it, either. It ain&rsquo;t no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it&rsquo;s his right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for, to get ourselves out of prison with. He said if we warn&rsquo;t prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean ornery person would steal when he warn&rsquo;t a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the slave patch and eat it; and he made me go and give the slaves a dime, without telling them what it was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we needed. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn&rsquo;t need it to get out of prison with, there&rsquo;s where the difference was. He said if I&rsquo;d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at that, though I couldn&rsquo;t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner, if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that, every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch. By-and-by he come out, and we went and set down on the wood-pile, to talk. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s all right, now, except tools; and that&rsquo;s easy fixed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tools?&rdquo; I says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tools for what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, to dig with. We ain&rsquo;t agoing to gnaw him out, are we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a slave out with?&rdquo; I says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huck Finn, did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels, and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with? Now I want to ask you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">if you got any reasonableness in you at all</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what kind of a show would that give him to be a hero? Why, they might as well lend him the key, and done with it. Picks and shovels</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">why they wouldn&rsquo;t furnish &rsquo;em to a king.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;if we don&rsquo;t want the picks and shovels, what do we want?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A couple of case-knives.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Confound it, it&rsquo;s foolish, Tom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make no difference how foolish it is, it&rsquo;s the right way</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and it&rsquo;s the regular way. And there ain&rsquo;t no other way, that ever I heard of, and I&rsquo;ve real all the books that gives any information about these things. They always dig out with a case-knife</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and not through dirt, mind you; generly it&rsquo;s through solid rock. And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever. Why, look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way; how long was he at it, you reckon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, guess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. A month and a half?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thirty-seven year</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and he come out in China. That&rsquo;s the kind. I wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jim don&rsquo;t know nobody in China.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that got to do with it? Neither did that other fellow. But you&rsquo;re always a-wandering off on a side issue. Why can&rsquo;t you stick to the main point?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I don&rsquo;t care where he comes out, so he comes out; and Jim don&rsquo;t, either, I reckon. But there&rsquo;s one thing, anyway</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Jim&rsquo;s too old to be dug out with a case-knife. He won&rsquo;t last.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes he will last, too. You don&rsquo;t reckon it&rsquo;s going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a dirt foundation, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How long will it take, Tom?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn&rsquo;t take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans. He&rsquo;ll hear Jim ain&rsquo;t from there. Then his next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that. So we can&rsquo;t resk being as long digging him out as we ought to. By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can&rsquo;t. Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can let on, to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years. Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there&rsquo;s an alarm. Yes, I reckon that&rsquo;ll be the best way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s sense in that,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Letting on don&rsquo;t cost nothing; letting on ain&rsquo;t no trouble; and if it&rsquo;s any object, I don&rsquo;t mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn&rsquo;t strain me none, after I got my hand in. So I&rsquo;ll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Smouch three,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;we want one to make a saw out of.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tom, if it ain&rsquo;t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weatherboarding behind the smoke-house.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. Run along and smouch the knives</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">three of them.&rdquo; So I done it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.piccwx82xqz"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 36</a></span><span class="c9 c19 c24">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep, that night, we went down the lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile of fox-fire, and went to work. We cleared everything out of the way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. Tom said he was right behind Jim&rsquo;s bed now, and we&rsquo;d dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn&rsquo;t nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim&rsquo;s counterpin hung down most to the ground, and you&rsquo;d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. So we dug and dug, with the case-knives, till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn&rsquo;t see we&rsquo;d done anything, hardly. At last I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t no thirty-seven year job, this is a thirty-eight year job, Tom Sawyer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed he was thinking. Then he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no use, Huck, it ain&rsquo;t agoing to work. If we was prisoners it would, because then we&rsquo;d have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn&rsquo;t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn&rsquo;t get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done. But we can&rsquo;t fool along, we got to rush; we ain&rsquo;t got no time to spare. If we was to put in another night this way, we&rsquo;d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">couldn&rsquo;t touch a case-knife with them sooner.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. It ain&rsquo;t right, and it ain&rsquo;t moral, and I wouldn&rsquo;t like it to get out</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but there ain&rsquo;t only just the one way; we got to dig him out with the picks, and let on it&rsquo;s case-knives.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re talking! &rdquo; I says; &ldquo;your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don&rsquo;t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow. When I start in to steal a slave, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain&rsquo;t no ways particular how it&rsquo;s done so it&rsquo;s done. What I want is my slave; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick&rsquo;s the handiest thing, that&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;m agoing to dig that slave or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don&rsquo;t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this; if it warn&rsquo;t so, I wouldn&rsquo;t approve of it, nor I wouldn&rsquo;t stand by and see the rules broke</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain&rsquo;t got no business doing wrong when he ain&rsquo;t ignorant and knows better. It might answer for you to dig Jim out with a pick, without any letting-on, because you don&rsquo;t know no better; but it wouldn&rsquo;t for me, because I do know better. Gimme a case- knife.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gimme a case-knife.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t know just what to do</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but then I thought. I scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pick-ax and give it to him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He was always just that particular. Full of principle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and made the fur fly. We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it. When I got upstairs, I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn&rsquo;t come it, his hands was so sore. At last he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no use, it can&rsquo;t be done. What you reckon I better do? Can&rsquo;t you think up no way?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;but I reckon it ain&rsquo;t regular. Come up the stairs, and let on it&rsquo;s a lightning-rod.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So he done it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung around the slave cabins, and laid for a chance, and stole three tin plates. Tom said it wasn&rsquo;t enough; but I said nobody wouldn&rsquo;t ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they&rsquo;d fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">then we could tote them back and he could use them over again. So Tom was satisfied. Then he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Take them in through the hole,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;when we get it done.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By-and-by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn&rsquo;t no need to decide on any of them yet. Said we&rsquo;d got to post Jim first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn&rsquo;t wake him. Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the job was done. We crept in under Jim&rsquo;s bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim a while, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us hunt up a cold chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with, right away, and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how un-regular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, sure. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times a while, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now I know how to fix it. We&rsquo;ll send you some things by them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do nothing of the kind; it&rsquo;s one of the most jackass ideas I ever struck,&rdquo; but he never paid no attention to me; went right on. It was his way when he&rsquo;d got his plans set.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So he told Jim how we&rsquo;d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie, and other large things, by Nat, the slave that fed him, and he must be on the lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and we would put small things in uncle&rsquo;s coat pockets and he must steal them out; and we would tie things to aunt&rsquo;s apron strings or put them in her apron pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and what they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood, and all that. He told him everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim he couldn&rsquo;t see no sense in the most of it, but he al1owed we was white folks [i.e., could read] and knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just as Tom said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed, with hands that looked like they&rsquo;d been chawed. Tom was in high spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it. He said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the morning we went out to the wood-pile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket. Then we went to the slave cabins, and while I got Nat&rsquo;s notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone that was in Jim&rsquo;s pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out; and there warn&rsquo;t ever anything could a worked better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that&rsquo;s always getting into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places, first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And whilst we was a standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in, from under Jim&rsquo;s bed; and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn&rsquo;t hardly room in there to get your breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to door. The slave Nat he only just hollered &ldquo;witches!&rdquo; once, and keeled over onto the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was dying. Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim&rsquo;s meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door, and I knowed he&rsquo;d fixed the other door too. Then he went to work on the slave, coaxing him and petting him, and asking him if he&rsquo;d been imagining he saw something again. He raised up, and blinked his eyes around, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mars Sid, you&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;s a fool, but if I didn&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve I see most a million dogs, or devils, er some&rsquo;n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks.

What makes them come here just at this runaway slave&rsquo;s breakfast-time? It&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re hungry; that&rsquo;s the reason.

So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile in the back yard where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched around and found an old tin washpan and stopped up the holes as well as we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour, and started for breakfast and found a couple of shingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt Sally&rsquo;s apron pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t&rsquo;other we stuck in the band of Uncle Silas&rsquo;s hat, which was on the bureau, because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway slave&rsquo;s house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas&rsquo;s coat pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn&rsquo;t come yet, so we had to wait a little while.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And when she come she was hot, and red, and cross, and couldn&rsquo;t hardly wait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child&rsquo;s head with her thimble with the other, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hunted high, and I&rsquo;ve hunted low, and it does beat all, what has become of your other shirt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough and was shot across the table and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry out of him the size of a war-whoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder. But after that we was all right again</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold. Uncle Silas he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most uncommon curious, I can&rsquo;t understand it. I know perfectly well I took it off, because</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because you hain&rsquo;t got but one on.

But it&rsquo;s gone</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s the long and the short of it, and you&rsquo;ll just have to change to a red flann&rsquo;l one till I can get time to make a new one. And it&rsquo;ll be the third I&rsquo;ve made in two years; it just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to do with &rsquo;m all, is more&rsquo;n I can make out. A body&rsquo;d think you would learn to take some sort of care of &rsquo;em, at your time of life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. But it oughtn&rsquo;t to be altogether my fault, because you know I don&rsquo;t see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they&rsquo;re on me; and I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve ever lost one of them off of me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t your fault if you haven&rsquo;t, Silas</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you&rsquo;d a done it if you could, I reckon. And the shirt ain&rsquo;t all that&rsquo;s gone, nuther. Ther&rsquo;s a spoon gone; and that ain&rsquo;t all. There was ten, and now ther&rsquo;s only nine. The calf got the shirt I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, what else is gone, Sally?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ther&rsquo;s six candles gone</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s what. The rats could a got the candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don&rsquo;t walk off with the whole place, the way you&rsquo;re always going to stop their holes and don&rsquo;t do it; and if they warn&rsquo;t fools they&rsquo;d sleep in your hair, Silas</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you&rsquo;d never find it out; but you can&rsquo;t lay the spoon on the rats, and that I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, Sally, I&rsquo;m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I&rsquo;ve been remiss; but I won&rsquo;t let tomorrow go by without stopping up them holes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t hurry, next year&rsquo;ll do. Matilda Angelina Araminta Phelps! &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling around any. Just then, the slave woman steps onto the passage, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Missus, dey&rsquo;s a sheet gone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A sheet gone!

Where&rsquo;s it gone, Lize?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Clah to goodness I hain&rsquo;t no notion, Miss Sally. She wuz on de clo&rsquo;s-line yistiddy, but she done gone; she ain&rsquo; dah no mo,&rsquo; now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I reckon the world is coming to an end. I never see the beat of it, in all my born days. A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Missus,&rdquo; comes a young slave wench, &ldquo;dey&rsquo;s a brass cannelstick miss&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Cler out from here, you hussy, er I&rsquo;ll take a skillet to ye!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, she was just a biling. I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated. She kept a raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket. She stopped, with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long; because she says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I expected. So you had it in your pocket all the time; and like as not you&rsquo;ve got the other things there, too. How&rsquo;d it get there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I reely don&rsquo;t know, Sally,&rdquo; he says, kind of apologizing, &ldquo;or you know I would tell. I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen, before breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put my Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain&rsquo;t in, but I&rsquo;ll go and see, and if the Testament is where I had it, I&rsquo;ll know I didn&rsquo;t put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the spoon, and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, for the land&rsquo;s sake! Give a body a rest! Go &rsquo;long now, the whole kit and biling of ye; and don&rsquo;t come nigh me again till I&rsquo;ve got back my peace of mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I&rsquo;d a heard her, if she&rsquo;d a said it to herself, let alone speaking it out; and I&rsquo;d a got up and obeyed her, if I&rsquo;d a been dead. As we was passing through the setting-room, the old man he took up his hat, and the shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out. Tom see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t no use to send things by him no more, he ain&rsquo;t reliable.&rdquo; Then he says: &ldquo;But he done us a good turn with the spoon, anyway, without knowing it, and so we&rsquo;ll go and do him one without him knowing it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">stop up his rat-holes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was a noble good lot of them, down cellar, and it took us a whole hour, but we done the job tight and good, and ship-shape. Then we heard steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light, and hid; and here comes the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t&rsquo;other, looking as absent-minded as year before last. He went a mooning around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he&rsquo;d been to them all. Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle and thinking. Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs, saying:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, for the life of me I can&rsquo;t remember when I done it. I could show her now that I warn&rsquo;t to blame on account of the rats. But never mind</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">let it go. I reckon it wouldn&rsquo;t do no good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And so he went on a mumbling up stairs, and then we left. He was a mighty nice old man. And always is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said we&rsquo;d got to have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out, he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and Tom says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Aunt Sally, there ain&rsquo;t but nine spoons, yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Go &rsquo;long to your play, and don&rsquo;t bother me. I know better, I counted &rsquo;m myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve counted them twice, Aunty, and I can&rsquo;t make but nine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">anybody would.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I declare to gracious ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t but nine!&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Why, what in the world</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">plague take the things, I&rsquo;ll count &rsquo;m again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther&rsquo;s ten, now!&rdquo; and she looked huffy and bothered both. But Tom says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Aunty, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s ten.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You numskull, didn&rsquo;t you see me count &rsquo;m?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know, but</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll count &rsquo;m again</span><span class="c4">.</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I smouched one, and they come out nine same as the other time. Well, she was in a tearing way</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">just a trembling all over, she was so mad. But she counted and counted, till she got that addled she&rsquo;d start to count-in the basket for a spoon, sometimes; and so, three times they come out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west; and she said cle&rsquo;r out and let her have some peace, and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner, she&rsquo;d skin us. So we had the odd spoon; and dropped it in her apron pocket whilst she was a giving us our sailing-orders, and Jim got it all right, along with her shingle-nail, before noon. We was very well satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took, because he said now she couldn&rsquo;t ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;d counted them right, if she did; and, said that after she&rsquo;d about counted her head off, for the next three days, he judged she&rsquo;d give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So we put the sheet back on the line, that night, and stole one out of her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again, for a couple of days, till she didn&rsquo;t know how many sheets she had, any more, and said she didn&rsquo;t care, and warn&rsquo;t agoing to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it, and wouldn&rsquo;t count them again not to save her life, she druther die first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn&rsquo;t no consequence, it would blow over by-and-by.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we had to use up three washpans full of flour, before we got through, and we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the smoke; because, you see, we didn&rsquo;t want nothing but a crust, and we couldn&rsquo;t prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of course we thought of the right way at last; which was to cook the ladder, too, in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim, the second night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings, and twisted them together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope, that you could a hung a person with. We let on it took nine months to make it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn&rsquo;t go in the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope enough for forty pies, if we&rsquo;d a wanted them, and plenty left over for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could a had a whole dinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But we didn&rsquo;t need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and so we throwed the rest away. We didn&rsquo;t cook none of the pies in the washpan, afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable, not on account of being any account because they warn&rsquo;t, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first pies, because we didn&rsquo;t know how, but she come up smiling on the last one. We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and loaded her up with rag-rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope-ladder wouldn&rsquo;t cramp him down to business, I don&rsquo;t know nothing what I&rsquo;m talking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nat didn&rsquo;t look, when we put the witch-pie in Jim&rsquo;s pan; and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope-ladder inside of his straw tick, and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.th8uewr6tw4x"><span class="c48 c50"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 38</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Making them pens was a distressid-tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That&rsquo;s the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But we had to have it; Tom said we&rsquo;d got to; there warn&rsquo;t no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look at Lady Jane Grey,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;look at Gilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland! Why, Huck, spose it is considerble trouble?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what you going to do?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">how you going to get around it? Jim&rsquo;s got to do his inscription and coat of arms. They all do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Mars Tom, I hain&rsquo;t got no coat o&rsquo; arms; I hain&rsquo;t got nuffn but dish-yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s right, anyway, when he says he hain&rsquo;t got no coat of arms, because he hain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I reckon I knowed that,&rdquo; Tom says, &ldquo;but you bet he&rsquo;ll have one before he goes out of this</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">because he&rsquo;s going out right, and there ain&rsquo;t going to be no flaws in his record.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim a making his&rsquo;n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms. By-and-by he said he&rsquo;d struck so many good ones he didn&rsquo;t hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he&rsquo;d decide on. He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;On the scutcheon we&rsquo;ll have a bend or in the dexter base, a saltire murrey in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field azure, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway slave, sable, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister: and a couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, Maggiore fretta, minore alto. Got it out of a book</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">means, the more haste, the less speed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Geewhillikins,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;but what does the rest of it mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t got no time to bother over that,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we got to dig in like all git-out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s some of it? What&rsquo;s a fess?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A fess</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">a fess is</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you don&rsquo;t need to know what a fess is. I&rsquo;ll show him how to make it when he gets to it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shucks, Tom,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I think you might tell a person. What&rsquo;s a bar sinister?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. But he&rsquo;s got to have it. All the nobility does.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That was just his way. If it didn&rsquo;t suit him to explain a thing to you, he wouldn&rsquo;t do it. You might pump at him a week, it wouldn&rsquo;t make no difference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He&rsquo;d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a mournful inscription</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">said Jim got to have one, like they all done. He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">1. Here a captive heart busted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the world and friends, fretted out his sorrowful life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">3. Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">4. Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis XIV.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tom&rsquo;s voice trembled, whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down. When he got done, he couldn&rsquo;t no way make up his mind which one for Jim to scrabble onto the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on. Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck onto the logs with a nail, and he didn&rsquo;t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block them out for him, and then he wouldn&rsquo;t have nothing to do but just follow the lines. Then pretty soon he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Come to think, the logs ain&rsquo;t agoing to do; they don&rsquo;t have log walls in a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. We&rsquo;ll fetch a rock.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock, he wouldn&rsquo;t ever get out. But Tom said he would let me help him do it. Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn&rsquo;t give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we didn&rsquo;t seem to make no headway, hardly. So Tom says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know how to fix it. We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock. There&rsquo;s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we&rsquo;ll smouch it, and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">It warn&rsquo;t no slouch of an idea; and it warn&rsquo;t no slouch of a grindstone nuther; but we allowed we&rsquo;d tackle it. It warn&rsquo;t quite midnight, yet, so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work. We smouched the grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn&rsquo;t keep her from falling over, and she come mighty near mashing us, every time. Tom said she was going to get one of us, sure, before we got through. We got her half way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat. We see it warn&rsquo;t no use, we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and Tom superintended. He could out-superintend any boy I ever see. He knowed how to do everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Our hole was pretty big, but it warn&rsquo;t big enough to get the grindstone through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough. Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it. Then we helped him fix his chain back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves. But Tom thought of something, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You got any spiders in here, Jim?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain&rsquo;t, Mars Tom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll get you some.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But bless you, honey, I doan&rsquo; want none. I&rsquo;s afeard un um. I jis&rsquo; &rsquo;s soon have rattlesnakes aroun&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tom thought a minute or two, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good idea. And I reckon it&rsquo;s been done. It must a been done; it stands to reason. Yes, it&rsquo;s a prime good idea. Where could you keep it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Keep what, Mars Tom?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, a rattlesnake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah, I&rsquo;d take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid my head.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Jim, you wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of it, after a little. You could tame it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tame it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">easy enough. Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting, and they wouldn&rsquo;t think of hurting a person that pets them. Any book will tell you that. You try</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s all I ask; just try for two or three days. Why, you can get him so, in a little while, that he&rsquo;ll love you; and sleep with you; and won&rsquo;t stay away from you a minute; and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please, Mars Tom</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;doan&rsquo; talk so! I can&rsquo;t stan&rsquo; it! He&rsquo;d let me shove his head in my mouf</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">fer a favor, hain&rsquo;t it? I lay he&rsquo;d wait a pow&rsquo;ful long time &rsquo;fo&rsquo; I ast him. En mo&rsquo; en dat, I doan&rsquo; want him to sleep wid me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Jim, don&rsquo;t act so foolish. A prisoner&rsquo;s got to have some kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain&rsquo;t ever been tried, why, there&rsquo;s more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Mars Tom, I doan&rsquo; want no sich glory. Snake take &rsquo;n bite Jim&rsquo;s chin off, den whah is de glory? No, sah, I doan&rsquo; want no sich doin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Blame it, can&rsquo;t you try? I only want you to try</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you needn&rsquo;t keep it up if it don&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But de trouble all done, ef de snake bite me while I&rsquo;s a tryin&rsquo; him. Mars Tom, I&rsquo;s willin&rsquo; to tackle mos&rsquo; anything &rsquo;at ain&rsquo;t onreasonable, but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I&rsquo;s gwyue to leave, dat&rsquo;s shore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you&rsquo;re so bullheaded about it. We can get you some garter-snakes and you can tie some buttons on their tails, and let on they&rsquo;re rattlesnakes, and I reckon that&rsquo;ll have to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I k&rsquo;n stan&rsquo; dem, Mars Tom, but blame&rsquo; &rsquo;f I couldn&rsquo; get along widout um, I tell you dat. I never knowed b&rsquo;fo&rsquo;, &rsquo;t was so much bother and trouble to be a prisoner.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it always is, when it&rsquo;s done right. You got any rats around here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, sah, I hain&rsquo;t seed none.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll get you some rats.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Mars Tom, I doan&rsquo; want no rats. Dey&rsquo;s de dad-blamedest creturs to sturb a body, en rustle roun&rsquo; over &rsquo;im, en bite his feet, when he&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo; to sleep, I ever see. No, sah, gimme g&rsquo;yarter-snakes, &rsquo;f I&rsquo;s got to have &rsquo;m, but doan&rsquo; gimme no rats, I ain&rsquo; got no use f&rsquo;r um, skasely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But Jim, you got to have &rsquo;em</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">they all do. So don&rsquo;t make no more fuss about it. Prisoners ain&rsquo;t ever without rats. There ain&rsquo;t no instance of it. And they train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies. But you got to play music to them. You got anything to play music on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I ain&rsquo; got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o&rsquo; paper, en a juice-harp; but I reck&rsquo;n dey wouldn&rsquo; take no stock in a juice-harp.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes they would. They don&rsquo;t care what kind of music &rsquo;tis. A jews-harp&rsquo;s plenty good enough for a rat. All animals likes music</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">in a prison they dote on it. Specially, painful music; and you can&rsquo;t get no other kind out of a jews-harp. It always interests them; they come out to see what&rsquo;s the matter with you. Yes, you&rsquo;re all right; you&rsquo;re fixed very well. You want to set on your bed, nights, before you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play The Last Link is Broken</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;ll scoop a rat, quicker&rsquo;n anything else: and when you&rsquo;ve played about two minutes, you&rsquo;ll see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you, and come. And they&rsquo;ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, dey will, I reck&rsquo;n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is Jim havin&rsquo;? Blest if I kin see de pint. But I&rsquo;ll do it ef I got to. I reck&rsquo;n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de house.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tom waited to think over, and see if there wasn&rsquo;t nothing else; and pretty soon he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there&rsquo;s one thing I forgot. Could you raise a flower here, do you reckon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I doan&rsquo; know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it&rsquo;s tolable dark in heah, en I ain&rsquo; got no use f&rsquo;r no flower, nohow, en she&rsquo;d be a pow&rsquo;ful sight o&rsquo; trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you try it, anyway. Some other prisoners has done it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;One er dem big cat-tail-lookin&rsquo; mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars Tom, I reck&rsquo;n, but she wouldn&rsquo; be wuh half de trouble she&rsquo;d coss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it. We&rsquo;ll fetch you a little one, and you plant it in the corner, over there, and raise it. And don&rsquo;t call it mullen, call it Pitchiola</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s its right name, when it&rsquo;s in a prison. And you want to water it with your tears.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want spring water; you want to water it with your tears. It&rsquo;s the way they always do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man&rsquo;s a start&rsquo;n one wid tears.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t the idea. You got to do it with tears.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll die on my han&rsquo;s, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan&rsquo; skasely ever cry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So Tom was stumped. But he studied it over, and then said Jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion. He promised he would go to the slave cabins and drop one, private, in Jim&rsquo;s coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would &ldquo;jis&rsquo; &rsquo;s soon have tobacker in his coffee&rdquo;; and found so much fault with it, and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisouer than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself, and yet he didn&rsquo;t know enough to appreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him. So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn&rsquo;t behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.4od0j4pssie5"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 39</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat trap and fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat hole, and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally&rsquo;s bed. But while we was gone for spiders, little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was a standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her. So she took and dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn&rsquo;t the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock. I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like-to got a hornet&rsquo;s nest, but we didn&rsquo;t. The family was at home. We didn&rsquo;t give it right up, but staid with them as long as we could; because we allowed we&rsquo;d tire them out or they&rsquo;d got to tire us out, and they done it. Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right again, but couldn&rsquo;t set down convenient. And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper time, and a rattling good honest day&rsquo;s work; and hungry?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">oh, no, I reckon not! And there warn&rsquo;t a blessed snake up there, when we went back</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">we didn&rsquo;t half tie the sack, and they worked out, somehow, and left. But it didn&rsquo;t matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. So we judged we could get some of them again. No, there warn&rsquo;t no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerble spell. You&rsquo;d see them dripping from the rafters and places, every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn&rsquo;t want them. Well, they was handsome, and striped, and there warn&rsquo;t no harm in a million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally, she despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she couldn&rsquo;t stand them no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn&rsquo;t make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out. I never see such a woman. And you could hear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn&rsquo;t get her to take aholt of one of them with the tongs. And if she turned over and found one in bed, she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire. She disturbed the old man so, that he said he could most wish there hadn&rsquo;t ever been no snakes created. Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week, Aunt Sally warn&rsquo;t over it yet; she warn&rsquo;t near over it; when she was setting thinking about something, you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings. It was very curious. But Tom said all women was just so. He said they was made that way; for some reason or other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way; and she allowed these lickings warn&rsquo;t nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them. I didn&rsquo;t mind the lickings, because they didn&rsquo;t amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had, to lay in another lot. But we got them laid in, and all the other things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim&rsquo;s was when they&rsquo;d all swarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn&rsquo;t like the spiders, and the spiders didn&rsquo;t like Jim; and so they&rsquo;d lay for him and make it mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats, and the snakes, and the grindstone, there warn&rsquo;t no room in bed for him, skasely; and when there was, a body couldn&rsquo;t sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he said, because they never all slept at one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t&rsquo;other gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place, the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out, this time, he wouldn&rsquo;t ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, by the end of three weeks, everything was in pretty good shape. The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust, and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. We reckoned we was all going to die, but didn&rsquo;t. It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see; and Tom said the same. But as I was saying, we&rsquo;d got all the work done, now, at last; and we was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway slave, but hadn&rsquo;t got no answer, because there warn&rsquo;t no such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones, it give me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn&rsquo;t no time to lose. So Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s them?&rdquo; I says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Warnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it&rsquo;s done one way, sometimes another. But there&rsquo;s always somebody spying around, that gives notice to the governor of the castle. When Louis XVI was going to light out of the Tooleries, a servant girl done it. It&rsquo;s a very good way, and so is the nonnamous letters. We&rsquo;ll use them both. And it&rsquo;s usual for the prisoner&rsquo;s mother to change clothes with him, and she stays in, and he slides out in her clothes. We&rsquo;ll do that too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But looky here, Tom, what do we want to warn anybody for, that something&rsquo;s up? Let them find it out for themselves</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it&rsquo;s their lookout.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I know; but you can&rsquo;t depend on them. It&rsquo;s the way they&rsquo;ve acted from the very start</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">left us to do everything. They&rsquo;re so confiding and mullet-headed they don&rsquo;t take notice of nothing at all. So if we don&rsquo;t give them notice, there won&rsquo;t be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape&rsquo;ll go off perfectly flat: won&rsquo;t amount to nothing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">won&rsquo;t be nothing to it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, as for me, Tom, that&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shucks,&rdquo; he says, and looked disgusted. So I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I ain&rsquo;t going to make no complaint. Anyway that suits you suits me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be her. You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that slave girl&rsquo;s frock.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Tom, that&rsquo;ll make trouble next morning; because of course she prob&rsquo;ly hain&rsquo;t got any but that one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know; but you don&rsquo;t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, then, I&rsquo;ll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my own togs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t look like a servant-girl then, would you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, but there won&rsquo;t be nobody to see what I look like, anyway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t got nothing to do with it. The thing for us to do, is just to do our duty, and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it or not. Hain&rsquo;t you got no principle at all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All right, I ain&rsquo;t saying nothing; I&rsquo;m the servant-girl. Who&rsquo;s Jim&rsquo;s mother?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m his mother. I&rsquo;ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, you&rsquo;ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not much. I&rsquo;ll stuff Jim&rsquo;s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim&rsquo;ll take the slave woman&rsquo;s gown off of me and wear it, and we&rsquo;ll all evade together. When a prisoner of style escapes, it&rsquo;s called an evasion. It&rsquo;s always called so when a king escapes, f&rsquo;rinstance. And the same with a king&rsquo;s son; it don&rsquo;t make no difference whether he&rsquo;s a natural one or an unnatural one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the slave wench&rsquo;s frock, that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the way Tom told me to. It said:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Beware. Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout. UNKNOWN FRIEND.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Next night we stuck a picture which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and crossbones, on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin, on the back door. I never see a family in such a sweat. They couldn&rsquo;t a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air. If a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped, and said &ldquo;ouch!&rdquo; if anything fell, she jumped and said &ldquo;ouch!&rdquo; if you happened to touch her, when she warn&rsquo;t noticing, she done the same; she couldn&rsquo;t face noway and be satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every time</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">so she was always a whirling around, sudden, and saying &ldquo;ouch,&rdquo; and before she&rsquo;d get two-thirds around, she&rsquo;d whirl back again, and say it again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn&rsquo;t set up. So the thing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So he said, now for the grand bulge! So the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a slave on watch at both doors all night. Tom he went down the lightning-rod to spy around; and the slave at the back door was asleep, and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back. This letter said:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t betray me, I wish to be your friend. There is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the Ingean Territory going to steal your runaway slave to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them. I am one of the gang, but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead a honest life again, and will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards, along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the slave&rsquo;s cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger; but stead of that, I will BA like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure. Don&rsquo;t do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoopjamboreehoo. I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">UNKNOWN FRIEND.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.nvt14ie7i8bn"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 40</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We was feeling pretty good, after breakfast, and took my canoe and went over the river a fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a look at the raft and found her all right. and got home late to supper, and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn&rsquo;t know which end they was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper, and wouldn&rsquo;t tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a word about the new letter, but didn&rsquo;t need to, because we knowed as much about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half upstairs and her back was turned, we slid for the cellar cubboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally&rsquo;s dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch, but says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the butter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I laid out a hunk of it,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;on a piece of a corn-pone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you left it laid out, then</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">it ain&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can get along without it,&rdquo; I says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We can get along with it, too,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;just you slide down cellar and fetch it. And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along. I&rsquo;ll go and stuff the straw into Jim&rsquo;s clothes to represent his mother in disguise, and be ready to ba like a sheep and shove soon as you get there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a person&rsquo;s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started upstairs, very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You been down cellar?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What you been doing down there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Noth&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Noth&rsquo;n! &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No&rsquo;m.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, what possessed you to go down there, this time of night?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;m.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know ? Don&rsquo;t answer me that way, Tom, I want to know what you been doing down there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I reckoned she&rsquo;d let me go, now, and as a generl thing she would; but I spose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warn&rsquo;t yard-stick straight; so she says, very decided:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come. You been up to something you no business to, and I lay I&rsquo;ll find out what it is before I&rsquo;m done with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room. My, but there was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and every one of them had a gun. I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down. They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn&rsquo;t; but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats, and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their seats, and fumbling with their buttons. I warn&rsquo;t easy myself, but I didn&rsquo;t take my hat off, all the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we&rsquo;d overdone this thing, and what a thundering hornet&rsquo;s nest we&rsquo;d got ourselves into, so we could stop fooling around, straight off, and clear out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">At last she come, and begun to ask me questions, but I couldn&rsquo;t answer them straight, I didn&rsquo;t know which end of me was up; because these men was in such a fidget now, that some was wanting to start right now and lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn&rsquo;t but a few minutes to midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal; and here was aunty pegging away at the questions, and me a shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears: and pretty soon, when one of them says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for going and getting in the cabin first, and right now, and catching them when they come,&rdquo; I most dropped; and a streak of butter come a trickling down my forehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake what is the matter with the child!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">he&rsquo;s got the brain fever as shore as you&rsquo;re born, and they&rsquo;re oozing out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes the bread, and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and hugged me, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it ain&rsquo;t no worse; for luck&rsquo;s against us, and it never rains but it pours, and when I see that truck I thought we&rsquo;d lost you, for I knowed by the color and all, it was just like your brains would be if</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Dear, dear, whyd&rsquo;nt you tell me that was what you&rsquo;d been down there for, I wouldn&rsquo;t a cared. Now cler out to bed, and don&rsquo;t lemme see no more of you till morning!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was upstairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one, and shinning through the dark for the lean-to. I couldn&rsquo;t hardly get my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could, we must jump for it, now, and not a minute to lose</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the house full of men, yonder, with guns!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">His eyes just blazed; and he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">is that so? Ain&rsquo;t it bully! Why, Huck, if it was to do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! If we could put it off till</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hurry! hurry! &rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jim?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him. He&rsquo;s dressed, and everything&rsquo;s ready. Now we&rsquo;ll slide out and give the sheep-signal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But then we heard the tramp of men, coming to the door, and heard them begin to fumble with the padlock; and heard a man say:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told you we&rsquo;d be too soon; they haven&rsquo;t come</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">the door is locked. Here, I&rsquo;ll lock some of you into the cabin and you lay for &rsquo;em in the dark and kill &rsquo;em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece, and listen if you can hear &rsquo;em coming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So in they come, but couldn&rsquo;t see us in the dark, and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. But we got under all right, and out through the hole, swift but soft</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Jim first, me next, and Tom last, which was according to Tom&rsquo;s orders. Now we was in the lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. So we crept to the door, and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn&rsquo;t make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a scraping around, out there, all the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards the fence, in Indian file, and got to it, all right, and me and Jim over it; but Tom&rsquo;s britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks and started, somebody sings out:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that? Answer, or I&rsquo;ll shoot!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But we didn&rsquo;t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then there was a rush, and a bang, bang, bang! and the bullets fairly whizzed around us! We heard them sing out:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Here they are! They&rsquo;ve broke for the river! after &rsquo;em, boys! And turn loose the dogs!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them, because they wore boots, and yelled, but we didn&rsquo;t wear no boots, and didn&rsquo;t yell. We was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close onto us, we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them. They&rsquo;d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn&rsquo;t scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they come, making pow-wow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn&rsquo;t nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we up steam again and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn&rsquo;t make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out. And when we stepped onto the raft, I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now, old Jim, you&rsquo;re a free man again, and I bet you won&rsquo;t ever be a slave no more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. It &rsquo;uz planned beautiful, en it &rsquo;uz done beautiful; en dey ain&rsquo;t nobody kin git up a plan dat&rsquo;s mo&rsquo; mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We was all as glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all, because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When me and Jim heard that, we didn&rsquo;t feel so brash as what we did before. It was hurting him considerble, and bleeding; so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke&rsquo;s shirts for to bandage him, but he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Gimme the rags, I can do it myself. Don&rsquo;t stop, now; don&rsquo;t fool around here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set her loose! Boys, we done it elegant!</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rsquo;deed we did. I wish we&rsquo;d a had the handling of Louis XVI, there wouldn&rsquo;t a been no &lsquo;Son of Saint Louis, ascend to heaven!&rsquo; wrote down in his biography: no, sir, we&rsquo;d a whooped him over the border</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d a done with him </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and done it just as slick as nothing at all, too. Man the sweeps</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">man the sweeps!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But me and Jim was consulting</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and thinking. And after we&rsquo;d thought a minute, I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Say it, Jim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Ef it wuz him dat &rsquo;uz bein&rsquo; sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, &lsquo;Go on en save me, nemmine &rsquo;bout a doctor f&rsquo;r to save dis one? Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer? Would he say dat? You bet he wouldn&rsquo;t! Well, den, is Jim gwyne to say it? No, sah</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I doan&rsquo; budge a step out&rsquo;n dis place, &rsquo;dout a doctor; not if it&rsquo;s forty year!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he&rsquo;d say what he did say</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">so it was all right, now, and I told Tom I was agoing for a doctor. He raised considerble row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn&rsquo;t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn&rsquo;t let him. Then he give us a piece of his mind</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but it didn&rsquo;t do no good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So when he see me getting the canoe ready, he says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, then, if you&rsquo;re bound to go, I&rsquo;ll tell you the way to do, when you get to the village. Shut the door, and blindfold the doctor tight and fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres, in the dark, and then fetch him here in the canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take his chalk away from him, and don&rsquo;t give it back to him till you get him back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again. It&rsquo;s the way they all do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming, till he was gone again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.ch71hxgykfkr"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 41</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man, when I got him up. I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting, yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home this evening, and surprise the folks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who is your folks?&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The Phelpses, down yonder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he says. And after a minute, he says: &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you say he go shot?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He had a dream,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and it shot him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Singular dream,&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. But when he see the canoe, he didn&rsquo;t like the look of her</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">said she was big enough for one but didn&rsquo;t look pretty safe for two. I says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us, easy enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What three?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, me and Sid, and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and the guns; that&rsquo;s what I mean.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But he put his foot on the gunnel, and rocked her; and shook his head, and said he reckoned he&rsquo;d look around for a bigger one. But they was all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for the surprise, if I wanted to. But I said I didn&rsquo;t; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he started.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I struck an idea, pretty soon. I says to myself, spos&rsquo;n he can&rsquo;t fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep&rsquo;s tail, as the saying is? spos&rsquo;n it takes him three or four days? What are we going to do?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">lay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag? No, sir, I know what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll wait, and when he comes back, if he says he&rsquo;s got to go any more, I&rsquo;ll get down there, too, if I swim; and we&rsquo;ll take and tie him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom&rsquo;s done with him, we&rsquo;ll give him what it&rsquo;s worth, or all we got, and then let him get shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So then I crept into a lumber pile to get some sleep; and next time I waked up the sun was away up over my head! I shot out and went for the doctor&rsquo;s house, but they told me he&rsquo;d gone away in the night, some time or other, and warn&rsquo;t back yet. Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad for Tom, and I&rsquo;ll dig out for the island, right off. So away I shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas&rsquo;s stomach! He says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, Tom! Where you been, all this time, you rascal?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hain&rsquo;t been nowheres,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;only just hunting for the runaway slave</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">me and Sid.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, where ever did you go?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Your aunt&rsquo;s been mighty uneasy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;because we was all right. We followed the men and the dogs, but they out-run us, and we lost them; but we thought we heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them, and crossed over but couldn&rsquo;t find nothing of them; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago, then we paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid&rsquo;s at the post-office to see what he can hear, and I&rsquo;m a branching out to get something to eat for us, and then we&rsquo;re going home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So then we went to the post-office to get &ldquo;Sid&rdquo;; but just as I suspicioned, he warn&rsquo;t there; so the old man he got a letter out of the office, and we waited a while longer but Sid didn&rsquo;t come; so the old man said come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe-it, when he got done fooling around</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">but we would ride. I couldn&rsquo;t get him to let me stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn&rsquo;t no use in it, and I must come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">When we got home, Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don&rsquo;t amount to shucks, and said she&rsquo;d serve Sid the same when he come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And the place was plumb full of farmers and farmers&rsquo; wives, to dinner; and such another clack a body never heard. Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst; her tongue was agoing all the time.

It looks foolish enough, now, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there&rsquo;s my two poor boys asleep, &rsquo;way upstairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy &rsquo;t I crep&rsquo; up there and locked &rsquo;em in! I did. And anybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared, that way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and worse, all the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o&rsquo; wild things, and by-and-by you think to yourself, spos&rsquo;n I was a boy, and was away up there, and the door ain&rsquo;t locked, and you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo; She stopped, looking kind of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye lit on me</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I got up and took a walk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning, if I go out to one side and study over it a little. So I done it. But I dasn&rsquo;t go fur, or she&rsquo;d a sent for me. And when it was late in the day, the people all went, and then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and &ldquo;Sid,&rdquo; and the door was locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn&rsquo;t never want to try that no more. And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before; and then she said she&rsquo;d forgive us, and maybe it was all right enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot, as fur as she could see; and so, as long as no harm hadn&rsquo;t come of it, she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of fretting over what was past and done. So then she kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, lawsamercy, it&rsquo;s most night, and Sid not come yet! What has become of that boy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I see my chance; so I skips up and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run right up to town and get him,&rdquo; I says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay right wher&rsquo; you are; one&rsquo;s enough to be lost at a time. If he ain&rsquo;t here to supper, your uncle&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, he warn&rsquo;t there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">He come back about ten, a little bit uneasy; hadn&rsquo;t run across Tom&rsquo;s track. Aunt Sally was a good deal uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said there warn&rsquo;t no occasion to be</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">boys will be boys, he said, and you&rsquo;ll see this one turn up in the morning, all sound and right. So she had to be satisfied. But she said she&rsquo;d set up for him a while, anyway, and keep a light burning, so he could see it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn&rsquo;t look her in the face and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn&rsquo;t seem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every now and then, if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and might be laying at this minute, somewheres, suffering or dead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down, silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was in so much trouble. And when she was going away, she looked down in my eyes, so steady and gentle, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The door ain&rsquo;t going to be locked, Tom; and there&rsquo;s the window and the rod; but you&rsquo;ll be good, won&rsquo;t you? And you won&rsquo;t go? For my sake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Laws knows I wanted to go, bad enough, to see about Tom, and was all intending to go; but after that, I wouldn&rsquo;t a went, not for kingdoms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But she was on my mind, and Tom was on my mind; so I slept very restless. And twice I went down the rod, away in the night, and slipped around front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do something for her, but I couldn&rsquo;t, only to swear that I wouldn&rsquo;t never do nothing to grieve her any more. And the third time, I waked up at dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out, and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.t8mvjrx6f46u"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter 42</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The old man was up town again, before breakfast, but couldn&rsquo;t get no track of Tom; and both of them set at the table, thinking, and not saying nothing, and looking mournful, and, their coffee getting cold, and not eating anything. And by-and-by the old man says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did I give you the letter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What letter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t give me no letter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I must a forgot it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.

But before she could break it open, she dropped it and run</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">for she see something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old doctor; and Jim, in her calico dress, with his hands tied behind him; and a lot of people. I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy, and rushed. She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Oh, he&rsquo;s dead, he&rsquo;s dead, I know he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other, which showed he warn&rsquo;t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive, thank God! And that&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; and she snatched a kiss of him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders right and left at the slaves and everybody else, as fast as her tongue could go, every jump of the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. The men was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim, for an example to all the other slaves around there, so they wouldn&rsquo;t be trying to run away, like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights. But the others said, don&rsquo;t do it, it wouldn&rsquo;t answer at all, he ain&rsquo;t our slave, and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So that cooled them down a little, because the people that&rsquo;s always the most anxious for to hang a slave that hain&rsquo;t done just right, is always the very ones that ain&rsquo;t the most anxious to pay for him when they&rsquo;ve got their satisfaction out of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two, side the head, once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg, this time, but to a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both legs, and said he warn&rsquo;t to have nothing but bread and water to eat, after this, till his owner come or he was sold at auction, because he didn&rsquo;t come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night, and a bull-dog tied to the door in the daytime; and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes a look, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be no rougher on him than you&rsquo;re obleeged to, because he ain&rsquo;t a bad slave. When I got to where I found the boy, I see I couldn&rsquo;t cut the bullet out without some help, and he warn&rsquo;t in no condition for me to leave, to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn&rsquo;t let me come anigh him, any more, and said if I chalked his raft he&rsquo;d kill me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn&rsquo;t do anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have help, somehow; and the minute I says it, out crawls this slave from somewheres, and says he&rsquo;ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. Of course I judged he must be a runaway slave, and there I was! and there I had to stick, right straight along all the rest of the day, and all night. It was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I&rsquo;d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn&rsquo;t, because the slave might get away, and then I&rsquo;d be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick, plumb till daylight this morning; and I never see a slave that was a better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was resking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he&rsquo;d been worked main hard, lately. I liked the slave for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a slave like that is worth a thousand dollars</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and kind treatment, too. I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I was, with both of &rsquo;m on my hands; and there I had to stick, till about dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it, the slave was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees, sound asleep; so I motioned them in, quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the slave never made the least row nor said a word, from the start. He ain&rsquo;t no bad slave, gentlemen; that&rsquo;s what I think about him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Somebody says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I&rsquo;m obleeged to say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man, the first time I see him. Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some notice took of it, and reward. So every one of them promised, right out and hearty, that they wouldn&rsquo;t cuss him no more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Then they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water, but they didn&rsquo;t think of it, and I reckoned it warn&rsquo;t best for me to mix in, but I judged I&rsquo;d get the doctor&rsquo;s yarn to Aunt Sally, somehow or other, as soon as I&rsquo;d got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me. Explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot, when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway slave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day and all night; and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around, I dodged him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and laid for him to wake. In about a half an hour, Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still, and set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now, because all the symptoms was first rate, and he&rsquo;d been sleeping like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time, and ten to one he&rsquo;d wake up in his right mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So we set there watching, and by-and-by he stirs a bit, and opened his eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&lsquo;&lsquo;Hello, why I&rsquo;m at home! How&rsquo;s that? Where&rsquo;s the raft?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; I says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And Jim ?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; I says, but couldn&rsquo;t, say it pretty brash. But be never noticed, but says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good! Splendid! Now we&rsquo;re all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;About what, Sid?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, about the way the whole thing was done.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What whole thing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, the whole thing. There ain&rsquo;t but one; how we set the runaway slave free</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">me and Tom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good land! Set the run</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">What is the child talking about! Dear, dear, out of his head again!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t out of my HEAD; I know all what I&rsquo;m talking about. We did set him free</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we done it. And we done it elegant, too.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d got a start, and she never checked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I see it warn&rsquo;t no use for me to put in. &ldquo;Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">weeks of it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can&rsquo;t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can&rsquo;t think half the fun it was. And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and make the rope-ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work with, in your apron pocket&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mercy sakes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let them go by, and when the dogs come they warn&rsquo;t interested in us, but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and wasn&rsquo;t it bully, Aunty!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So it was you, you little rapscallions, that&rsquo;s been making all this trouble, and turned everybody&rsquo;s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death. I&rsquo;ve as good a notion as ever I had in my life, to take it out o&rsquo; you this very minute. To think, here I&rsquo;ve been, night after night, a</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">you just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I&rsquo;ll tan the Old Harry out o&rsquo; both o&rsquo; ye!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">But Tom, he was so proud and joyful, he just couldn&rsquo;t hold in, and his tongue just went it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat-convention; and she says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well</span><span class="c4">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now, for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Meddling with who ?&rdquo; Tom says, dropping his smile and looking surprised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;With who ? Why, the runaway slave, of course. Who&rsquo;d you reckon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tom looks at me very grave, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tom, didn&rsquo;t you just tell me he was all right? Hasn&rsquo;t he got away?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Him ?&rdquo; says Aunt Sally; &ldquo;the runaway slave? &rsquo;Deed he hasn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;ve got him back, safe and sound, and he&rsquo;s in that cabin again, on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he&rsquo;s claimed or sold!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills, and sings out to me:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They hain&rsquo;t no right to shut him up! Shove! </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">and don&rsquo;t you lose a minute. Turn him loose! he ain&rsquo;t no slave; he&rsquo;s as free as any cretur that walks this earth!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What does the child mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I mean every word I say, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don&rsquo;t go, I &rsquo;ll go. I&rsquo;ve knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river, and said so; and she set him free in her will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then what on earth did you want to set him free for, seeing he was already free?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that is a question, I must say; and just like women! Why, I wanted the adventure of it; and I&rsquo;d a waded neck-deep in blood to</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">goodness alive, AUNT POLLY!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">If she warn&rsquo;t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as sweet and contented as an angel half-full of pie, I wish I may never!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And I peeped out, and in a little while Tom&rsquo;s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">kind of grinding him into the earth, you know. And then she says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, you better turn y&rsquo;r head away</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">I would if I was you, Tom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, deary me!&rdquo; says Aunt Sally; &ldquo;is he changed so? Why, that ain&rsquo;t Tom it&rsquo;s Sid; Tom&rsquo;s</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">Tom&rsquo;s</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">why, where is Tom? He was here a minute ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You mean where&rsquo;s Huck Finn </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that&rsquo;s what you mean! I reckon I hain&rsquo;t raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years, not to know him when I see him. That would be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that bed, Huck Finn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">So I done it. But not feeling brash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest looking persons I ever see; except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in, and they told it all to him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn&rsquo;t know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that give him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in the world couldn&rsquo;t a understood it. So Tom&rsquo;s Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">she chipped in and says, &ldquo;Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I&rsquo;m used to it, now, and &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no need to change&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer, I had to stand it</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">there warn&rsquo;t no other way, and I knowed he wouldn&rsquo;t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and he&rsquo;d make an adventure out of it and be perfectly satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free slave free! and I couldn&rsquo;t ever understand, before, until that minute and that talk, how he could help a body set a slave free, with his bringing-up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and Sid had come, all right and safe, she says to herself:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and trapse all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that creetur&rsquo;s up to, this time; as long as I couldn&rsquo;t seem to get any answer out of you about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why, I never heard nothing from you,&rdquo; says Aunt Sally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I wonder! Why, I wrote to you twice, to ask you what you could mean by Sid being here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I never got &rsquo;em, Sis.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Aunt Polly, she turns around slow and severe, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You, Tom!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what ?&rdquo; he says, kind of pettish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you what me, you impudent thing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">hand out them letters.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What letters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Them letters.

There, now. And they&rsquo;re just the same as they was when I got them out of the office. I hain&rsquo;t looked into them, I hain&rsquo;t touched them. But I knowed they&rsquo;d make trouble, and I thought if you warn&rsquo;t in no hurry, I&rsquo;d</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you do need skinning, there ain&rsquo;t no mistake about it. And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I spose he</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it come yesterday; I hain&rsquo;t read it yet, but it&rsquo;s all right, I&rsquo;ve got that one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn&rsquo;t, but I reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to. So I never said nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.vts8imwt41ub"><span class="c20 c36"><a class="c5" href="#h.k7q031amxz2d">Chapter the Last</a></span><span class="c24 c9 c19">&nbsp;</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The first time I catched Tom, private, I asked him what was his idea, time of the evasion?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what it was he&rsquo;d planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a slave free that was already free before? And he said, what he had planned in his head, from the start, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river, on the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the slaves around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we. But I reckened it was about as well the way it was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom, they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And we had him up to the sick-room; and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good, and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c1">what I tell you up dah on Jackson islan&rsquo;?
